# The Art of War by Sun Tzu

> All warfare is based on deception. 18. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
---
> If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
---
> supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.
---
> If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
---
> To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
---
> What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
