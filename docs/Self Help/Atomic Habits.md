## The Secret to Results that last

> **Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.**
> 

In Chapter 1, I said, â€œIf youâ€™re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isnâ€™t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you donâ€™t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.â€

This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent solution. Whenever youâ€™re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. Round and round. Always looking for the next way to get 1 percent better.

**The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements.** Itâ€™s remarkable what you can build if you just donâ€™t stop. Itâ€™s remarkable the business you can build if you donâ€™t stop working. Itâ€™s remarkable the body you can build if you donâ€™t stop training. Itâ€™s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you donâ€™t stop learning. Itâ€™s remarkable the fortune you can build if you donâ€™t stop saving. Itâ€™s remarkable the friendships you can build if you donâ€™t stop caring. Small habits donâ€™t add up. They compound. 

Thatâ€™s the power of atomic habits. **Tiny changes. Remarkable results.**

## Little Lessons from Four Laws

**Happiness is simply the absence of desire.** When you observe a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently.

happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As Caed Budris says, 

> â€œHappiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.â€
> 

Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it.

**Emotions drive behavior.** Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes before response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.

**We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional.** The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first responseâ€”the fast, nonconscious portion of the brainâ€”is optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second responseâ€”the slow, conscious portion of the brainâ€”is the part that does the â€œthinking.â€

Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality only intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional thinking when they are not.

**Suffering drives progress.** The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack ambition.

**Your actions reveal how badly you want something.** If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you donâ€™t really want it. Itâ€™s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.

**Our expectations determine our satisfaction.** The gap between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the future. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so. 

For example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your expectation changes your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high expectations is a disappointment. An average experience preceded by low expectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are approximately the same, you feel satisfied. 

$$
Satisfaction = Liking â€“ Wanting
$$

This is the wisdom behind Senecaâ€™s famous quote, 

> â€œBeing poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.â€
> 

If your wants outpace your likes, youâ€™ll always be unsatisfied. Youâ€™re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the solution.

Happiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing publicly it took me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that milestone, I told my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated. I felt excited and motivated. A few years later, I realized that one thousand people were signing up each day. And yet I didnâ€™t even think to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results ninety times faster than before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasnâ€™t until a few days later that I realized how absurd it was that I wasnâ€™t celebrating something that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a few years before.

## Chapter 1 : The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

### Example

THE FATE OF British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The organization, which was the governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity. Since 1908, British riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even worse in cyclingâ€™s biggest race, the Tour de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event. In fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear. Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as â€œthe aggregation of marginal gains,â€ which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, â€œThe whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.â€

Brailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you might expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the bike seats to make them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better grip. They asked riders to wear electrically heated overshorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each athlete responded to a particular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which proved to be lighter and more aerodynamic. But they didnâ€™t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find 1 percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They tested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle recovery. They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. They determined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best nightâ€™s sleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes. As these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated, the results came faster than anyone could have imagined.

Just five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team dominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games came to London, the Brits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records and seven world records. That same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froome won the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the British team five Tour de France victories in six years. During the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured five Tour de France victories in what is widely regarded as the most successful run in cycling history.*

## Why Small changes make big difference

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ 1% BETTER EVERY DAY 1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03 **1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78**

</aside>

**Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.** The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss small changes because they donâ€™t seem to matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, youâ€™re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, youâ€™re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still havenâ€™t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesnâ€™t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. Itâ€™s the accumulation of many misstepsâ€”a 1 percent decline here and thereâ€”that eventually leads to a problem.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habitsâ€”not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

</aside>

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

### You Habits can compound For You or Against You

**Positive Compounding**

- Productivity compounds.
    - Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.
- Knowledge compounds.
    - Learning one new idea wonâ€™t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, â€œThatâ€™s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.â€
- Relationships compound.
    - People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.

**Negative Compounding**

- Stress compounds.
    - The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.
- Negative thoughts compound.
    - The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.
- Outrage compounds.
    - Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a single event. Instead, a long series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire.

## What Progress is Really Like

Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.

habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and itâ€™s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesnâ€™t feel like you are going anywhere. Itâ€™s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, â€œIâ€™ve been running every day for a month, so why canâ€™t I see any change in my body?â€ Once this kind of thinking takes over, itâ€™s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateauâ€”what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.

If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that itâ€™s the work you did long agoâ€”when it seemed that you werenâ€™t making any progressâ€”that makes the jump today possible.

It is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic plates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once again, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take yearsâ€”before it happens all at once.

one of the most successful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: 

> â€œWhen nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did itâ€”but all that had gone before.â€
> 

## THE PLATEAU OF LATENT POTENTIAL

We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we have done. This can result in a â€œvalley of disappointmentâ€ where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was simply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.

All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time. 

But what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to survive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other side? What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits and enables others to enjoy the compounding effects of good ones?

## Forget About Goals Focus on System Instead

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™s the difference between systems and goals? Itâ€™s a distinction I first learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert comic. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

</aside>

- If youâ€™re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice.
- If youâ€™re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.

The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, â€œThe score takes care of itself.â€ The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.

### Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.

Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It wasnâ€™t the goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year beforeâ€”just like every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.

### Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.

Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean roomâ€”for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon youâ€™ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. Youâ€™re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.

### Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.

The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: â€œOnce I reach my goal, then Iâ€™ll be happy.â€ The problem with a goals-first mentality is that youâ€™re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. Iâ€™ve slipped into this trap so many times Iâ€™ve lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax. 

Furthermore, goals create an â€œeither-orâ€ conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. 

A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you donâ€™t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

### Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.

Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a â€œyo-yoâ€ effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.

> The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. Itâ€™s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.
> 

## A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS

If youâ€™re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isnâ€™t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you donâ€™t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
> 

Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the word atomic.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.**

</aside>

### Chapter Summary

- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. An

## Chapter 2 : how Your habits shape your identity

## Three Layers of Behavior Change

**The first layer is changing your outcomes.** This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change. 

**The second layer is changing your process.** This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level. 

**The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.** This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.

## Identity based habits

Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then youâ€™ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, youâ€™ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training. Itâ€™s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you havenâ€™t changed who you are.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. Itâ€™s one thing to say Iâ€™m the type of person who wants this. Itâ€™s something very different to say Iâ€™m the type of person who is this.

The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If youâ€™re proud of how your hair looks, youâ€™ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If youâ€™re proud of the size of your biceps, youâ€™ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If youâ€™re proud of the scarves you knit, youâ€™ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, youâ€™ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.

**True behavior change is identity change.** You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason youâ€™ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you donâ€™t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

for Example

- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
- The goal is not to run marathon but become a runner.

Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you areâ€”either consciously or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. For example, people who identified as â€œbeing a voterâ€ were more likely to vote than those who simply claimed â€œvotingâ€ was an action they wanted to perform. Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity doesnâ€™t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.

The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if itâ€™s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any levelâ€”individual, team, societyâ€”is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because youâ€™re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you canâ€™t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

## Two Step Process to changing your identity

Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.*

**New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes youâ€™ve always cast, youâ€™re going to get the same results youâ€™ve always had.** If nothing changes, nothing is going to change. It is a simple two-step process: 

- Decide the type of person you want to be.
- Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.

## Chapter 3 : How to Build Better habits in 4 Simple steps

Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats.

He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door â€œby some simple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform.â€ For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food. 

Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door would open, and they would escape. 

Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food. 

After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example, Thorndike noted, â€œCat 12 took the following times to perform the act. 160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.â€ 

During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.

## Why your Brain Builds Habits

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, youâ€™re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndikeâ€™s cat, youâ€™re just trying things out to see what works.

Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act. Youâ€™re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action. 

Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution. Youâ€™re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run calms you down. Youâ€™re mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that playing video games relaxes you. Youâ€™re exploring, exploring, exploring, and thenâ€”BAMâ€”a reward.

**After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward. Wait a minuteâ€”that felt good. What did I do right before that? This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. Thatâ€™s a habit forming.**

Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly. As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, 

> **â€œHabits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.â€**
> 

As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choice that once required effort is now automatic. **A habit has been created.**

Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.

Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who donâ€™t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like youâ€™re behind the curve. If youâ€™re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasksâ€”when should I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay the billsâ€”then you have less time for freedom. Itâ€™s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.

### The Science of How habit works

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you wonâ€™t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you wonâ€™t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then youâ€™ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

### The Habit Loop

The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop. They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This â€œhabit loopâ€ is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.

1. **Cue**
2. **Craving**
3. **Response**
4. **Reward**

summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loopâ€”cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, rewardâ€”that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.

## The Four Laws of Behavior Change

### How to Create a Good Habit

- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.
- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

### How to Break Bad Habit

- Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.
- Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.
- Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.
- Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.

Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: 

- How can I make it obvious?
- How can I make it attractive?
- How can I make it easy?
- How can I make it satisfying?

If you have ever wondered, â€œWhy donâ€™t I do what I say Iâ€™m going to do? Why donâ€™t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirement or start that side business? Why do I say something is important but never seem to make time for it?â€ The answers to those questions can be found somewhere in these four laws. **The key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your specifications. Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.**

## Chapter 4 : The Man Who Didn't look right

Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you canâ€™t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, â€œUntil you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.â€

### The Habits Scorecard

The Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, youâ€™ll notice that the conductors have a peculiar habit. 

As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, â€œSignal is green.â€ As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When itâ€™s time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, â€œAll clear!â€ Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.* 

This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is â€œpoint-only,â€ and â€œwithin two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.â€ 

Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.

One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a â€œpoint-and-callâ€ system for our personal lives. Thatâ€™s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.

 Hereâ€™s a sample of where your list might start: 

- Wake up
- Turn off alarm
- Check my phone
- Go to the bathroom
- Weigh myself
- Take a shower
- Brush my teeth
- Floss my teeth
- Put on deodorant
- Hang up towel to dry
- Get dressed
- Make a cup of tea

 . . . and so on. Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, â€œIs this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?â€ If it is a good habit, write â€œ+â€ next to it. If it is a bad habit, write â€œâ€“â€. If it is a neutral habit, write â€œ=â€.

If youâ€™re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: â€œDoes this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?â€ Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

If you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as if you were watching someone else. Oh, how interesting that they would do such a thing. If you binge-eat, simply notice that you are eating more calories than you should. If you waste time online, notice that you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to.

The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. If you want to cut back on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, â€œIâ€™m about to eat this cookie, but I donâ€™t need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.â€

## Chapter 5 : The Best Way to Start a New Habit

The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit. 

The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of formsâ€”the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies, the sound of ambulance sirensâ€”but the two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues. 

Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: â€œWhen situation X arises, I will perform response Y.â€

### Habit Stacking

When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.

Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.* 

**The habit stacking formula is: â€œAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].â€** 

For example: 

- Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.
- Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my workout clothes.
- Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing Iâ€™m grateful for that happened today.
- Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss.

## Chapter 6 : Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

ANNE THORNDIKE, A primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improve the eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors without changing their willpower or motivation in the slightest way. In fact, she didnâ€™t plan on talking to them at all. 

Thorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter the â€œchoice architectureâ€ of the hospital cafeteria. They started by changing how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the refrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria were filled with only soda. The researchers added water as an option to each one. Additionally, they placed baskets of bottled water next to the food stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary refrigerators, but water was now available at all drink locations. 

Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increased by 25.8 percent. They made similar adjustmentsâ€”and saw similar resultsâ€”with the food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating there.  

People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, Iâ€™ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadnâ€™t been thinking about them beforehand and didnâ€™t necessarily feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, itâ€™s going to be hard not to grab one every now and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you.

In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: **Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment**, or B = f (P,E).

It didnâ€™t take long for Lewinâ€™s Equation to be tested in business. In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which â€œis triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.â€ In other words, customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them but because of how they are presented to them. 

For example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than those down near the floor. For this reason, youâ€™ll find expensive brand names featured in easy-to-reach locations on store shelves because they drive the most profit, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away in harder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which are the units at the end of aisles. End caps are moneymaking machines for retailers because they are obvious locations that encounter a lot of foot traffic. For example, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come specifically from end-of-the-aisle racks. 

The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and visit Starbucks because it is on every corner. We like to think that we are in control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted to do so. The truth, however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.

In humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system. We perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. But we also have other ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious, but many are nonconscious. For instance, you can â€œnoticeâ€ when the temperature drops before a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a stomachache, or when you fall off balance while walking on rocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide range of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your blood or the need to drink when thirsty.

The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the brainâ€™s resources are used on vision. Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.

## Chapter 7 : The Secret to Self Control

You can break a habit, but youâ€™re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirelyâ€”even if they go unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-run, **we become a product of the environment that we live in**. To put it bluntly, **I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.**

Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but itâ€™s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

## Chapter 8 : How to Make a Habit Irresistible

### Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.

Every behavior that is highly habit-formingâ€”taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social mediaâ€”is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially. 

For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement. 

When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act. 

It is the anticipation of a rewardâ€”not the fulfillment of itâ€”that gets us to take action.

### How To Use Temptation Bundling To Make Your Habits More Attractive

Ronan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland, enjoyed watching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercise more often than he did. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary bike and connected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote a computer program that would allow Netflix to run only if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for too long, whatever show he was watching would pause until he started pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan, â€œeliminating obesity one Netflix binge at a time.â€ 

He was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercise habit more attractive. Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrneâ€™s case, he bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing he needed to do).

**The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is**

- *After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].*
- *After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].*

If you want to read the news, but you need to express more gratitude: After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing Iâ€™m grateful for that happened yesterday (need). After I say one thing Iâ€™m grateful for, I will read the news (want).

Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want. Engineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be otherwise.

## Chapter 9 : The Role of  Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

IN 1965, a Hungarian man named Laszlo Polgar wrote a series of strange letters to a woman named Klara. 

Laszlo was a firm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all he believed in: he completely rejected the idea of innate talent. He claimed that with deliberate practice and the development of good habits, a child could become a genius in any field. His mantra was **â€œA genius is not born, but is educated and trained.â€** 

Laszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with his own childrenâ€”and he was writing to Klara because he â€œneeded a wife willing to jump on board.â€ Klara was a teacher and, although she may not have been as adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper instruction, anyone could advance their skills. 

Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment, and he laid out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies. The kids would be home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would be filled with chess books and pictures of famous chess players. The children would play against each other constantly and compete in the best tournaments they could find. The family would keep a meticulous file system of the tournament history of every competitor the children faced. Their lives would be dedicated to chess. 

Laszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the Polgars were parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit. 

Susan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old. Within six months, she was defeating adults. 

Sofia, the middle child, did even better. By fourteen, she was a world champion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster. 

Judit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat her father. At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among the top one hundred chess players in the world. At fifteen years and four months old, she became the youngest grandmaster of all timeâ€”younger than Bobby Fischer, the previous record holder. For twenty-seven years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess player in the world. 

The childhood of the Polgar sisters was atypical, to say the least. And yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle was attractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the sisters talk about their childhood as entertaining rather than grueling. They loved playing chess. They couldnâ€™t get enough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found Sofia playing chess in the bathroom in the middle of the night. Encouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, â€œSofia, leave the pieces alone!â€ To which she replied, â€œDaddy, they wonâ€™t leave me alone!â€ 

The Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all elseâ€”praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession with chess was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors youâ€™ll find.

### The Seductive Pull of Social Norms

For most of our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribeâ€”or worse, being cast outâ€”was a death sentence. â€œThe lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.â€* 

Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed increased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As Charles Darwin noted, â€œIn the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.â€ As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.

## Chapter 10 : How to find and fix causes of bad behaviour

### Where Cravings Come From

craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to achieve status. 

Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and youâ€™ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature. 

- Find love and reproduce = using Tinder
- Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook
- Win social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram
- Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google
- Achieve status and prestige = playing video games

Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.

### How To Reprogram Your Brain To Enjoy Hard Habits

You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family. 

Now, imagine changing just one word: You donâ€™t â€œhaveâ€ to. You â€œgetâ€ to. 

You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities. 

The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.

I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, â€œIâ€™m not confined to my wheelchairâ€”I am liberated by it. If it wasnâ€™t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.â€ This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.

Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with fluidity and grace. You can reframe â€œI am nervousâ€ to â€œI am excited and Iâ€™m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.â€

## Chapter 11 : Walk Slowly but Never Backward

Motion makes you feel like youâ€™re getting things done. But really, youâ€™re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You donâ€™t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing. 

If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You donâ€™t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.

### How Long does it Actually Take to form a new Habit?

habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. **Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.**

One of the most common questions I hear is, â€œHow long does it take to build a new habit?â€ But what people really should be asking is, â€œHow many does it take to form a new habit?â€ That is, how many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic? 

There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. It doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s been twenty-one days or thirty days or three hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior. You could do something twice in thirty days, or two hundred times. Itâ€™s the frequency that makes the difference. Your current habits have been internalized over the course of hundreds, if not thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the same level of frequency. You need to string together enough successful attempts until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line.

## Chapter 12 : The Law of Least Effort

### The Shape of Human Behaviour

Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.* For example, expanding your farm to the east where you can grow the same crops rather than heading north where the climate is different. Out of all the possible actions we could take, the one that is realized is the one that delivers the most value for the least effort. We are motivated to do what is easy.

Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required, the less likely it is to occur. **If your goal is to do a hundred push-ups per day, thatâ€™s a lot of energy! In the beginning, when youâ€™re motivated and excited, you can muster the strength to get started. But after a few days, such a massive effort feels exhausting. Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost no energy to get started.** And the less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.

**Every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You donâ€™t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacleâ€”that is, the more difficult the habitâ€”the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.** This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that youâ€™ll do them even when you donâ€™t feel like it. If you can make your good habits more convenient, youâ€™ll be more likely to follow through on them.

### How to Achieve More with Less Effort

Perhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your home or office. Too often, we try to start habits in high-friction environments. We try to follow a strict diet while we are out to dinner with friends. We try to write a book in a chaotic household. We try to concentrate while using a smartphone filled with distractions. It doesnâ€™t have to be this way. We can remove the points of friction that hold us back. This is precisely what electronics manufacturers in Japan began to do in the 1970s. 

In an article published in the New Yorker titled â€œBetter All the Time,â€ James Suroweicki writes: â€œJapanese firms emphasized what came to be known as â€˜lean production,â€™ relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the production process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workers didnâ€™t have to waste time twisting and turning to reach their tools. The result was that Japanese factories were more efficient and Japanese products were more reliable than American ones. In 1974, service calls for American-made color televisions were five times as common as for Japanese televisions. By 1979, it took American workers three times as long to assemble their sets.â€

If you look at the most habit-forming products, youâ€™ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping for groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions. Ride-sharing services reduce the friction of getting across town. Text messaging reduces the friction of sending a letter in the mail. 

Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace to reduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number of fields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks required to create an account. They deliver their products with easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers to make fewer choices.

## Chapter 13 : How to  Stop Procrastinating by Using the two Minute Rule

### The Two minute Rule

Even when you know you should start small, itâ€™s easy to start too big. When you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon. The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, **â€œWhen you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.â€**

Youâ€™ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute version: 

- â€œRead before bed each nightâ€ becomes â€œRead one page.â€
- â€œDo thirty minutes of yogaâ€ becomes â€œTake out my yoga mat.â€
- â€œStudy for classâ€ becomes â€œOpen my notes.â€
- â€œFold the laundryâ€ becomes â€œFold one pair of socks.â€
- â€œRun three milesâ€ becomes â€œTie my running shoes.â€

The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away. And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once youâ€™ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy. What you want is a â€œgateway habitâ€ that naturally leads you down a more productive path.

People often think itâ€™s weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you canâ€™t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details.

## Chapter 14 : How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

IN THE SUMMER OF 1830, Victor Hugo was facing an impossible deadline. Twelve months earlier, the French author had promised his publisher a new book. But instead of writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated, Hugoâ€™s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831. 

Hugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected all of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left with nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any suitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously during the fall and winter of 1830. The Hunchback of Notre Dame was published two weeks early on January 14, 1831.

* Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device.

### One Time Actions That Lock In Good habits

During the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new time management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset the passwords on all my social media accounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I worked without distraction. On Friday, she would send me the new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what social media had to offer until Monday morning when she would do it again. (If you donâ€™t have an assistant, team up with a friend or family member and reset each otherâ€™s passwords each week.)

## Chapter 15 : The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change

Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to repeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he was around. Within a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting. 

Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them. 

The first three laws of behavior changeâ€”make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easyâ€”increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior changeâ€”make it satisfyingâ€”increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop.

## Chapter 16 : How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

### How to Keep Your habits On Track

â€œDonâ€™t break the chainâ€ is a powerful mantra. Donâ€™t break the chain of sales calls and youâ€™ll build a successful book of business. Donâ€™t break the chain of workouts and youâ€™ll get fit faster than youâ€™d expect. Donâ€™t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio. Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.

### Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.

Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of Xâ€™s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the calendar and see your streak, youâ€™ll be reminded to act again. Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those who donâ€™t.

Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice whatâ€™s really going on each day.

### Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.

The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.

### Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.

This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar.

Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: youâ€™re focused on the process rather than the result. Youâ€™re not fixated on getting six-pack abs, youâ€™re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesnâ€™t miss workouts.

### How To Recover Quickly When Your Habits Break Down

No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before long, an emergency will pop upâ€”you get sick or you have to travel for work or your family needs a little more of your time. 

Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice. 

If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing one workout happens, but Iâ€™m not going to miss two in a row. Maybe Iâ€™ll eat an entire pizza, but Iâ€™ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I canâ€™t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, I get started on the next one. 

The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

### Knowing When (and When Not) To Track A Habit

Say youâ€™re running a restaurant and you want to know if your chef is doing a good job. One way to measure success is to track how many customers pay for a meal each day. If more customers come in, the food must be good. If fewer customers come in, something must be wrong. 

However, this one measurementâ€”daily revenueâ€”only gives a limited picture of whatâ€™s really going on. Just because someone pays for a meal doesnâ€™t mean they enjoy the meal. Even dissatisfied customers are unlikely to dine and dash. In fact, if youâ€™re only measuring revenue, the food might be getting worse but youâ€™re making up for it with marketing or discounts or some other method. Instead, it may be more effective to track how many customers finish their meal or perhaps the percentage of customers who leave a generous tip. 

The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your success is measured by quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and accounting for quarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower number on the scale, even if that means embracing crash diets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to â€œwinâ€ whatever game is being played.

This is sometimes referred to as Goodhartâ€™s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, â€œWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.â€ Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.

## Chapter 17 : How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good at his job.

The possibility of a customer never returning makes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the wrong blood vessel makes a surgeon master human anatomy and cut carefully. When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly. 

The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.

If youâ€™re going to rely on punishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action. To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a restaurant or failing to recycle adds consequence to an action. Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.

### Habit Contract

Bryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, Tennessee, was the first person I saw put this strategy into action. Shortly after the birth of his son, Harris realized he wanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit contract between himself, his wife, and his personal trainer. The first version read, â€œBryanâ€™s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eating correctly again so he feels better, looks better, and is able to hit his long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10% body fat.â€ **He also Listed the Punishment if he failed.**

Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesnâ€™t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says, â€œItâ€™s 6:10 and Iâ€™m not up because Iâ€™m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didnâ€™t malfunction.â€

## Chapter 18 : The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don't)

The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.

Embracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that people are born with different abilities. Some people donâ€™t like to discuss this fact. On the surface, your genes seem to be fixed, and itâ€™s no fun to talk about things you cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological determinism makes it sound like certain individuals are destined for success and others doomed to failure. But this is a shortsighted view of the influence of genes on behavior.

> Genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your your areas of opportunity.
> 

### How to find Game where odds are in your favour

When you canâ€™t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.

## Chapter 19 : The Goldilocks Rule : How to Stay Motivated in your life

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.

![](Chapter%2019%20The%20Goldilocks%20Rule%20How%20to%20Stay%20Motivat/screenshot_2020_09_12T20_25_300530_(2).png)

Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.

### How to Stay Focused when you get bored working on your goals

As Machiavelli noted, 

> â€œMen desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.â€
> 

Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements of surprise.

In psychology, this is known as a **variable reward**.* Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.

We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would like to fulfill, but it doesnâ€™t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when itâ€™s convenient or exciting, then youâ€™ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.

I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you donâ€™t feel like showing up. When youâ€™re at the gym, there will be sets that you donâ€™t feel like finishing. When itâ€™s time to write, there will be days that you donâ€™t feel like typing. But stepping up when itâ€™s annoying or painful or draining to do so, thatâ€™s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.

Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.

There have been a lot of sets that I havenâ€™t felt like finishing, but Iâ€™ve never regretted doing the workout. There have been a lot of articles I havenâ€™t felt like writing, but Iâ€™ve never regretted publishing on schedule. There have been a lot of days Iâ€™ve felt like relaxing, but Iâ€™ve never regretted showing up and working on something that was important to me. 

The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.

## Chapter 20 : The downside of Creating Good Habit

The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume youâ€™re getting better because youâ€™re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habitsâ€”not improving them. In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been mastered there is usually a slight decline in performance over time. 

Usually, this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry. You donâ€™t need a system to continuously improve how well you brush your teeth or tie your shoes or make your morning cup of tea. With habits like these, good enough is usually good enough. The less energy you spend on trivial choices, the more you can spend it on what really matters. 

However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You canâ€™t repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice. 

$$
Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
$$

Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Old tasks become easier the second time around, but it doesnâ€™t get easier overall because now youâ€™re pouring your energy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. Itâ€™s an endless cycle.

### Mastering a Field

![](Chapter%2020%20The%20downside%20of%20Creating%20Good%20Habit/screenshot_2020_09_12T20_41_000530_(2).png)

Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve. It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skillâ€”right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortableâ€”that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency. 

The solution? **Establish a system for reflection and review.**

Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday.

Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. There is too much feedback. Conversely, never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror. You arenâ€™t aware of easily fixable flawsâ€”a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your teeth. There is too little feedback. Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the important changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to view the entire mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley. 

Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important aspects of behavior change: identity.

### How To Break The Beliefs That Hold You Back

the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working against you, your identity creates a kind of â€œprideâ€ that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits.

The more sacred an idea is to usâ€”that is, the more deeply it is tied to our identityâ€”the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. You see this in every industry. The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching methods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran manager who is committed to doing things â€œhis way.â€ The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of her younger colleagues. The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.

Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and actingâ€”even when the world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you. 

**A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.**
