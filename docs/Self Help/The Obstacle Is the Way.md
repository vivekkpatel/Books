title: The Obstacle Is the Way

# The Obstacle Is the Way by Ryan Holiday

## Intro
The original idea behind this book is teach you how to overcome your obstacles. It may be physical, mental.emotional

Normally this book will explain how we approach a specific obstacle in our life. 
It mainly focuses on thinking **every obstacle as a way to improve yourself**.

### The Obstacles That Lie Before Us
- Today, most of our obstacles are internal, not external. Since World
 War II we have lived in some of the most prosperous times in history.
 There are fewer armies to face, fewer fatal diseases and far more safety
 nets. But the world still rarely does exactly what we want.
- Instead of opposing enemies, we have internal tension. We have
 professional frustration. We have unmet expectations. We have learned
 helplessness. And we still have the same overwhelming emotions
 humans have always had: grief, pain, loss.
- **Many of our problems come from having too much: rapid
 technological disruption, junk food, traditions that tell us the way we’re
 supposed to live our lives. We’re soft, entitled, and scared of conflict.
 Great times are great softeners. Abundance can be its own obstacle, as
 many people can attest.**
- Our generation needs an approach for overcoming obstacles and
 thriving amid chaos more than ever. One that will help turn our problems
 on their heads, using them as canvases on which to paint master works.

> Obstacles are actually opportunities to test ourselves, to try new things and ultimately to triumph.

## The Discipline of Perception

!!! quote "Warren Buffet"
    *“Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."*

- We must try to be objective.
- To control emotions and keep an even keel.
- To choose to see the good in a situation.
- To steady our nerves.
- To ignore what disturbs or limits others.
- To place things in perspective.
- To revert to the present moment.
- To focus on what can be controlled.
