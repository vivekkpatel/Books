“For a moment the kiss is gentle, careful - I'm so conscious of my not knowing, of his knowing - and then he utters a sound so low in his throat that it may be a cry of need or perhaps sorrow muffled against my mouth. Then we're not longer gentle, and I no longer care that I don't know what I'm doing because I know.”
― Rosaria Munda, Fireborne

"There was greatness in them. But with that greatness came arrogance, and with that arrogance corruption, and with that corruption downfall."

"Maybe you could be my maidservant or something."
"I don't know how to be a maidservant."
"I think they just wash things. You're really good at that. Want to plan the trip with me."
