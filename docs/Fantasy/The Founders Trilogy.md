# The Founders Trilogy by Robert Jackson

## Foundryside

“All things have a value. Sometimes the value is paid in coin. Other times, it is paid in time and sweat. And finally, sometimes it is paid in blood.

Humanity seems most eager to use this latter currency. And we never note how much of it we’re spending, unless it happens to be our own.”

― Robert Jackson Bennett, Foundryside

**“Every innovation—technological, sociological, or otherwise—begins as a crusade, organizes itself into a practical business, and then, over time, degrades into common exploitation.”** 
“This is simply the life cycle of how human ingenuity manifests in the material world. What goes forgotten, though, is that those who partake in this system undergo a similar transformation: people begin as comrades and fellow citizens, then become labor resources and assets, and then, as their utility shifts or degrades, transmute into liabilities, and thus must be appropriately managed.” 
― Robert Jackson Bennett, Foundryside

“One day I’ll live a life that doesn’t force me to make such cold-blooded decisions, she thought. But today is not that day.”

“Pride…it’s so often an excuse for people to be weak.” 
― Robert Jackson Bennett, Foundryside

## Shorefall

“Learn what your city has forgotten. What men of power have forgotten time and time again, throughout history—that there is always, always something mightier.” ― Robert Jackson Bennett, Shorefall

“remember the plan,” said Sancia. “I just also remember there’s a lot of spots in the plan that say, ‘Sancia improvises a bunch of shit.’ Which is not, you know, comforting.” ― Robert Jackson Bennett, Shorefall

“You can't control innovation! You can't structure how people invent! That's not how any of this shit works! Making and inventing is an ugly, stupid, random, dangerous process - just like humanity itself.” ― Robert Jackson Bennett, Shorefall
