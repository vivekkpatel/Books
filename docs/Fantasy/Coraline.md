# Coraline by Neil Gaiman

“Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.” 
― Neil Gaiman, Coraline

“I don't want whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted just like that, and it didn't mean anything? What then?” ― Neil Gaiman, Coraline

“Because,' she said, 'when you're scared but you still do it anyway, that's brave.” ― Neil Gaiman, Coraline
