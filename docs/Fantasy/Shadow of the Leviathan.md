## The Tainted Cup

!!! quote "Robert Jackson Bennett, The Tainted Cup"
    *“That’s the problem with figuring shit out—eventually you run into someone who’d prefer all their shit remained thoroughly unfigured.”*

“Civilization is often a task that is only barely managed. But harden your heart and slow your blood. The towers of justice are built one brick at a time. We have more to build yet.”
― Robert Jackson Bennett, The Tainted Cup

“The thing about war, boy, is while it happens, you’ve no idea what’s going on—and when it’s over, everyone spends the rest of your life telling you what you did.”
― Robert Jackson Bennett, The Tainted Cup
