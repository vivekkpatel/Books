## Quotes

How a person felt about action don't matter, only the actions themselves mattered.

It's much easier to TELL yourself you're a good person than it is to actually be one.

>All those jobs involve people, and I’m terrible with people. Magic is the one area where I can shut myself in a room with my books and my thoughts and come out more powerful than I went in. It doesn’t matter how big, or strong, or pretty you are in magic. It doesn’t matter how much people like you. With my fingers on the keys of a spellograph, if I can just think hard enough, I’m the most powerful person in the world. 

Truth over delusion. Growth over comfort.
