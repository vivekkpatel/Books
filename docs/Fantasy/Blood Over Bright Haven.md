# Blood Over Bright Haven by M.L. Wang

## Initial Impression about book
- I am 30% done with book and really love it.
- This is my second book by M L wang and i really enjoying her writing so far.
- There's lot of similarity between both book, it's setup in male driven society and our protagnist is woman with better skill than any male.
- It's a story about a girl named Sciona. She is an orphan girl who have spent his entire life to study of magic.She did managed passed her test for high mage to be first woman who ever admitted to high Magistry. This is major social thing for their culture where woment don't get credit for their work. 
- Another main character is Thomil who is janitor at high magistry who just become assistent to sciona. Thomil is from another culture taciturn who was hunter before his entire family is killed in some magical accident.

## Magic System
- Mage use device called "Spellograph" to type complex spell. it looks like typewriter.
- They just program each spell as per specific use case
