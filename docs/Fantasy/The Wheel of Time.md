# The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan

“I will hate the man you choose because he is not me, and love him if he makes you smile. No woman deserves the sure knowledge of widow’s black as her brideprice, you least of all.”
― Robert Jordan, The Eye of the World

“Relax, lad. Take life as it comes. Run when you have to, fight when you must, rest when you can.”
― Robert Jordan, The Eye of the World

“If you watch the wolf too hard, a mouse will bite you on the ankle”
― Robert Jordan, The Eye of the World

“It was easier to be brave when someone needed your protection.”
― Robert Jordan, The Eye of the World

“You'll use it, boy, and as long as you hate using it, you will use it more wisely than most men would. Wait. If ever you don't hate it any longer, then will be the time to throw it as far as you can and run the other way.”
― Robert Jordan, The Eye of the World

“Violence harms the one who does it as much as the one who receives it. You could cut down a tree with an axe. The axe does violence to the tree, and escapes unharmed. Is that how you see it? Wood is soft compared to steel, but the sharp steel is dulled as it chops, and the sap of the tree will rust and pit it. The mighty axe does violence to the helpless tree, and is harmed by it. So it is with men, though the harm is in the spirit.” ― Robert Jordan, The Eye of the World
