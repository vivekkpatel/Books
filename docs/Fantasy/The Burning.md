## The Rage of Dragons
**“The days without difficulty are the days you do not improve.”

― Evan Winter, The Rage of Dragons

“He was not the strongest, the quickest, or the most talented, not by any measure. He knew this and knew he could not control this. However, he could control his effort, the work he put in, and there he would not be beaten.”

― Evan Winter, The Rage of Dragons

“The wars you’ll wage aren’t decided when you fight them. They’re decided before that, by the extent of your effort and the substance of your sacrifices. They are decided by the choices you make every single day. So ask yourself: ‘how powerful do I choose to be?”
― Evan Winter, The Rage of Dragons

## The Fires of Vengence

“Rage is love...twisted in on itself. Rage reaches into the world when we can no longer contain the hurt of being treated as if our life and loves do not matter. Rage, and its consequences, are what we get when the world refuses to change for anything less.” 
― Evan Winter, The Fires of Vengeance

“Rage reaches into the world when we can no longer contain the hurt of being treated as if our life and loves do not matter. Rage, and its consequences, are what we get when the world refuses to change for anything less.”

“only path to becoming what others cannot is to suffer what others will not.” 
― Evan Winter, The Fires of Vengeance

“There’s more of us than them, and when we finally refuse to survive on the scraps they throw us, our numbers will make all the difference.”

“You call me a monster because I won’t let you treat me like my life is worthless, a thing to be used and thrown away?” it said. “You call me a monster because I refuse to live like you think I deserve? If that’s what you mean by monster, watch me be monstrous!”
