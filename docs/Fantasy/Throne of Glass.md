# Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas

## Throne of Glass

“Libraries were full of ideas—perhaps the most dangerous and powerful of all weapons.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

“You could rattle the stars," she whispered. "You could do anything, if only you dared. And deep down, you know it, too. That’s what scares you most.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

“No. I can survive well enough on my own— if given the proper reading material.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

“We all bear scars,... Mine just happen to be more visible than most.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

“No matter what happens," she said quietly, "I want to thank you."
Chaol tilted his head to the side. "For what?"
Her eyes stung but she blamed it on the fierce wind and blinked away the dampness. "For making my freedom mean something.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

“She moaned into her pillow. "Go away. I feel like dying."
"No fair maiden should die alone," he said, putting a hand on hers. "Shall I read to you in your final moments? What story would you like?"
She snatched her hand back. "How about the story of the idiotic prince who won't leave the assassin alone?"
"Oh! I love that story! It has such a happy ending, too—why, the assassin was really feigning her illness in order to get the prince's attention! Who would have guessed it? Such a clever girl. And the bedroom scene is so lovely—it's worth reading through all of their ceaseless banter!”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

“Of course." He picked up the brown bag of candy on the table. "What's your . . ." He trailed off as he weighed the bag in his hands. "Didn't I give you three pounds of candy?"
She smiled impishly.
"You ate half the bag!"
"Was I supposed to save it?"
"I would have liked some!"
"You never told me that."
"Because I didn't expect you to consume all of it before breakfast!"
She snatched the bag from him and put it on the table. "Well, that just shows poor judgement on your part, doesn't it?”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

“Second place is a nice title for the first loser.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

“I'm not married,” he said softly, “because I can't stomach the idea of marrying a woman inferior to me in mind and spirit. It would mean the death of my soul.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

“You have the skills,” Chaol said, “but some of your moves are still undisciplined.”
“That’s never stopped me from killing before,” she spat.
Chaol chuckled at her agitation and pointed his sword at the rack, allowing her to get to her feet.
“Pick another—something different. Make it interesting, too. Something that will make me sweat, please.”
“You’ll be sweating when I skin you alive and squish your eyeballs beneath my feet,” she muttered, picking up the rapier.
“That’s the spirit.”
She practically threw the rapier into place, and drew the hunting knives without hesitation.
My dear old friends.
A wicked smile spread across her face.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Throne of Glass

## Crown of Midnight
“I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn't, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“Why are you crying?"
"Because," she whispered, her voice shaking, "you remind me of what the world ought to be. What the world can be.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“The rest of the world quieted into nothing. In that moment, after ten long years, Celaena looked at Chaol and realised she was home.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“What does that mean?" he demanded.
She smiled sadly. "You'll figure it out. And when you do..." She shook her head, knowing she shouldn't say it, but doing it anyway. "When you do, I want you to remember that it wouldn't have made any difference to me. It's never made any difference to me when it came to you. I’d still pick you. I’ll always pick you.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“Who said anything about shame?" She gestured down to her naked body, even though it was covered by the blanket. "Honestly, I'm surprised you're not strutting about, boasting to everyone. I certainly would be if I'd tumbled me.
"Does your love for yourself know no bounds?"
"Absolutely none.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“But death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“Some things you hear with your ears. Others, you hear with your heart.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“There had never been any line between them, only his own stupid fear and pride. Because from the moment he'd pulled her out of that mine in Endovier and she had set those eyes upon him, still fierce despite a year in hell, he'd been walking toward this, walking to her. So Chaol brushed away her tears, lifter her chin, and kissed her.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“He would move on. Because he would not be like the ancient kings in the song and keep her for himself. She deserved a loyal, brave knight who saw her for what she was and did not fear her. And he deserved someone who would look at him like that, even if the love wouldn't be the same, even if the girl wouldn't be her.

So Dorian closed his eyes, and took another long breath. And when he opened his eyes, he let her go.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“Celaena Sardothien wasn’t in league with Aelin Ashryver Galathynius.

Celaena Sardothien was Aelin Ashryver Galathynius, heir to the throne and rightful Queen of Terranes.

Celaena was Aelin Galathynius, the greatest living threat to Adarlan, the one person who could raise an army capable of standing against the king. Now, she was also the one person who knew the secret source of the king’s power—and who sought a way to destroy it.

And he had just sent her into the arms of her strongest potential allies: to the homeland of her mother, the kingdom of her cousin, and the domain of her aunt, Queen Maeve of the Fae.

Celaena was the lost Queen of Terrasen.

Chaol sank to his knees.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“There was a poem scribbled at the top of the Ashryver family tree, as though some student had dashed it down as a reminder while studying.

Ashryver Eyes
The fairest eyes, from legends old
Of brightest blue, ringed with gold

Bright blue eyes, ringed with gold. A strangled cry came out of him. How many times had he looked into those eyes? How many times had he seen her avert her gaze, that one bit proof she couldn't hide, from the king?

Celaena Sardothien wasn't in league with Aelin Ashryver Galathynius.

Celaena Sardothien was Aelin Ashryver Galathynius, heir to the throne and righful Queen of Terrasen.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

“Whatever shred of hope he'd had for a future with her was gone. She still felt something for him, she'd admitted, but she would never trust him. She would always hate him for what he'd done.

But he could do this for her. Even if he never saw her again, even if she abandoned her duties as King's Champion and stayed with the Fae in Wendlyn forever-as long as he knew that she was safe, that no one could hurt her... He'd sell his soul again and again for that.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Crown of Midnight

### Heir of Fire
“She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Heir of Fire

“You cannot pick and choose what parts of her to love.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Heir of Fire

“Chaol kept his sword drawn. “I will not go to Anielle,” he growled. “And I will not serve you a moment longer. There is one true king in this room—­there always has been. And he is not sitting on that throne.”
Dorian stiffened.
But Chaol went on. “There is a queen in the north, and she has already beaten you once. She will beat you again. And again. Because what she represents, and what your son represents, is what you fear most: hope. You cannot steal it, no matter how many you rip from their homes and enslave. And you cannot break it, no matter how many you murder.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Heir of Fire

### Queen of Shadows

“Fire-breathing bitch-queen.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Queen of Shadows

“You make me want to live, Rowan. Not survive; not exist. Live.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Queen of Shadows

“She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Queen of Shadows

“She looked at them, at the three males who meant everything—more than everything. Then she smiled with every last shred of courage, of desperation, of hope for the glimmer of that glorious future. **“Let’s go rattle the stars.”**
― Sarah J. Maas, Queen of Shadows

“I missed you,” he said quietly, his gaze darting between her mouth and eyes. “When I was in
Wendlyn. I lied when I said I didn’t. From the moment you left, I missed you so much I went out of my mind. I was glad for the excuse to track Lorcan here, just to see you again. And tonight, when he had that knife at your throat …” The warmth of his callused finger bloomed through her as he traced a path over the cut on her neck. “I kept thinking about how you might never know that I missed you with only an ocean between us. But if it was death separating us … I would find you. I don’t care how many rules it would break. Even if I had to get all three keys myself and open a gate, I would find you again. Always.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Queen of Shadows

“But perhaps the monsters needed to look out for each other every now and then.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Queen of Shadows

“What in hell is that?”
She kept going toward the bathroom, refusing to apologize or look down at the pink, delicate, very
short lace nightgown. When she emerged, face washed and clean, Rowan was sitting up, arms crossed
over his bare chest. “You forgot the bottom part.”
She merely blew out the candles in the room one by one. His eyes tracked her the entire time.
“There is no bottom part,” she said, flinging back the covers on her side. “It’s starting to get so hot,
and I hate sweating when I sleep. Plus, you’re practically a furnace. So it’s either this or I sleep
naked. You can sleep in the bathtub if you have a problem with it.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Queen of Shadows

“You and I are nothing but wild beasts wearing human skins.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Queen of Shadows

“The wrath Chaol found in Aelin’s eyes was world-ending. “You bring my court into this, Chaol,” Aelin said with lethal softness, “and I don’t care what you were to me, or what you have done to help me. You betray them, you hurt them, and I don’t care how long it takes, or how far you go: I’ll burn you and your gods-damned kingdom to ash. Then you’ll learn just how much of a monster I can be.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Queen of Shadows

## Empire of Storms

“The world,” Aelin said, “will be saved and remade by the dreamers, Rolfe.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“Even when this world is a forgotten whisper of dust between the stars, I will always love you.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“He was hers and she was his and they had found each other across centuries of bloodshed and loss, across oceans and kingdoms and war.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“You will find, Rolfe, that one does not deal with Celaena Sardothien. One survives her”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“The useless sentries in the watchtower are now all half in love with you,” he lied. “One said he wanted to marry you.”
A low snarl. He yielded a foot but held eye contact with her as he grinned. “But you know what I told them? I said that they didn't stand a chance in hell. Because I am going to marry you,” he promised her. “One day. I am going to marry you. I'll be generous and let you pick when, even if it's ten years from now. Or twenty. But one day, you are going to be my wife.”
He shrugged. “Princess Lysandra Ashryver sounds nice, doesn't it?”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“Aelin Galathynius had raised an army not just to challenge Morath, but to rattle the stars.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“The fear of loss . . . it can destroy you as much as the loss itself.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“Aelin had promised herself, months and months ago, that she would not pretend to be anything but what she was. She had crawled through darkness and blood and despair-she had survived.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“You know, you ladies can let us males do things every now and then.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“Aelin was insane, Dorian realized. Brilliant and wicked, but insane.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“Rowan’s always looking for an excuse to show off. Dramatic rescues give him purpose and fulfillment in his dull, immortal life.” There”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“He gripped her hard, forcing her to meet his eyes as he snarled, “I see you. I see every part of you. And I am not afraid.”
I will not be afraid.
A line in the burning brightness.
My name is Aelin Ashryver Galathynius . . .
And I will not be afraid.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“And Elide sobbed as Manon Blackbeak emerged, smiling faintly.
As Manon Blackbeak saw her and Aelin, knee-to-knee in the grass, and mouthed one word.
Hope.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Empire of Storms

“Where do you think you’re going?” Darrow demanded.
She looked over her shoulder. “To call in old debts and promises. To raise an army of assassins and thieves and exiles and commoners. To finish what was started long, long ago.”

## Tower of Dawn

“He’d almost told the princess that she could keep Hellas’s Horse, but there was something to be said about the prospect of charging down Morath foot soldiers atop a horse named Butterfly.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Tower of Dawn

“A gift.
A gift from a queen who had seen another woman in hell and thought to reach back a hand. With no thought of it ever being returned. A moment of kindness, a tug on a thread.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Tower of Dawn

“What did Aelin promise you?” Hasar smiled to herself. “A better world.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Tower of Dawn

“Using the chair is not a punishment. It is not a prison,' he said softly. 'It never was. And I am as much of a man in that chair, or with that cane, as I am standing on my feet.' He brushed away the tear that slipped down her cheek.
'I wanted to heal you,' she breathed.
'You did,' he said, smiling. 'Yrene, in every way that truly matters . . . You did.'
Chaol wiped away the other tears that fell, brushing a kiss to her hot cheek.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Tower of Dawn

“Aelin frightens everyone…But not him. I think that’s why she fell in love with him, against her best intentions. Rowan beheld all Aelin was and is, and he was not afraid”
― Sarah J. Maas, Tower of Dawn

“The heart he’d offered and had been left to drop on the wooden planks of the river docks. An assassin who had sailed away and a queen who had returned.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Tower of Dawn

## Kingdom of Ash

“Once upon a time, in a land long since burned to ash, there lived a young princess who loved her kingdom …”
― Sarah J. Maas, Kingdom of Ash

“There are no gods left to watch, I’m afraid. And there are no gods left to help you now, Aelin Galathynius.'
Aelin smiled, and Goldryn burned brighter. 'I am a god.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Kingdom of Ash

“I am here, I am with you.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Kingdom of Ash

“And it was not darkness, but light—light, bright and pure as the sun on snow, that erupted from Asterin.
Light, as Asterin made the Yielding.
As the Thirteen, their broken bodies scattered around the tower in a near-circle, made the Yielding as well.
Light. They all burned with it. Radiated it.
Light that flowed from their souls, their fierce hearts as they gave themselves over to that power. Became incandescent with it.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Kingdom of Ash

“Fenrys … You know, I don’t actually know your family name.” Fenrys threw a roguish wink at the queen. “Moonbeam.” “It is not,” Aelin hissed, choking on a laugh. Fenrys laid a hand on his heart. “I am blood-sworn to you. Would I lie?”
― Sarah J. Maas, Kingdom of Ash

“I know you are tired, Fireheart. I know that the burden on your shoulders is more than anyone should endure. But we'll face this together. Erawan, the Lock, all of it. We'll face it together... We'll face it together. And if the cost of it truly is you, then we'll pay it together. As one soul in two bodies.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Kingdom of Ash

“We came," Manon said, loud enough that all on the city walls could hear, "to honor a promise made to Aelin Galathynius. To fight for what she promised us."
Darrow said quietly, "And what was that?"
Manon smiled then. "A better world.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Kingdom of Ash

“Aelin said to Fenrys, “We’ll only invite him to Orynth on holidays.” “So he can ruin the festivities?” Fenrys scowled. “I, for one, cherish my holidays. I don’t need a misanthrope raining on them.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Kingdom of Ash

“Lorcan rolled his eyes, and Aelin deemed that acceptance enough as she asked them all, “Did anyone bother to sleep?” Only Fenrys lifted his hand. Aedion frowned at the dark stain on the stones. “We’re putting a rug over it,” Aelin told him. Lysandra laughed. “Something tacky, I hope.” “I’m thinking pink and purple. Embroidered with flowers. Just what Erawan would have loved.” The Fae males gaped at them, Ren blinking. Elide ducked her head as she chuckled. Rowan snorted again. “At least this court won’t be boring.” Aelin put a hand on her chest, the portrait of outrage. “You were honestly worried it would be?” “Gods help us,” Lorcan grumbled.”
― Sarah J. Maas, Kingdom of Ash
