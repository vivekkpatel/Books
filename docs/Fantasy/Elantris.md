“Remember, the past need not become our future as well.”
― Brandon Sanderson, Elantris

“Do not dash if you only have the strength to walk, and do not waste your time pushing on the walls that will not give. More importantly, don't shove where a pat would be sufficient.”
― Brandon Sanderson, Elantris

“Definitely not—you optimists just can't understand that a depressed person doesn't want you to try and cheer them up. It makes us sick.”
― Brandon Sanderson, Elantris.

“The problem with being clever, Serene thought with a sigh, is that everyone assumes you're always planning something.”
― Brandon Sanderson, Elantris

“I'm Galladon, from the sovereign realm of Duladel.
I'm most recently from Elantris, land of sludge, insanity, and eternal perdition. Nice to meet you.”
― Brandon Sanderson, Elantris
