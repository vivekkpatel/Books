# The Invisible Life if Addie LaRue by V.E. Schwab

“Books, she has found, are a way to live a thousand lives--or to find strength in a very long one.” ― V.E. Schwab, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue

“What is a person, if not the marks they leave behind?” ― V.E. Schwab, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue

“Three words, large enough to tip the world. I remember you.” ― V.E. Schwab, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue

“What she needs are stories. Stories are a way to preserve one's self. To be remembered. And to forget. Stories come in so many forms: in charcoal, and in song, in paintings, poems, films. And books. Books, she has found, are a way to live a thousand lives—or to find strength in a very long one.” ― V.E. Schwab, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue

“Being forgotten, she thinks, is a bit like going mad. You begin to wonder what is real, if you are real. After all, how can a thing be real if it cannot be remembered?” ― V.E. Schwab, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue

“Do you know how to live three hundred years?” she says. And when he asks how, she smiles. “The same way you live one. A second at a time.” ― V.E. Schwab, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue

“That time always ends a second before you’re ready. That life is the minutes you want minus one.” ― V.E. Schwab, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue
