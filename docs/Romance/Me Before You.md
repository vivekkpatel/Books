# Me Before You by Jojo Moyes

> “You only get one life. It's actually your duty to live it as fully as possible.”
― Jojo Moyes, Me Before You
> 

> “Push yourself. Don't Settle. Just live well. Just LIVE.”
― Jojo Moyes, Me Before You
> 

> “Some mistakes... Just have greater consequences than others. But you don't have to let the result of one mistake be the thing that defines you. You, Clark, have the choice not to let that happen.”
― Jojo Moyes, Me Before You
> 

> “I will never, ever regret the things I've done. Because most days, all you have are places in your memory that you can go to.”
― Jojo Moyes, Me Before You
> 

> “All I can say is that you make me... you make me into someone I couldn't even imagine. You make me happy, even when you're awful. I would rather be with you - even the you that you seem to think is diminished - than with anyone else in the world.”
― Jojo Moyes, Me Before You
> 

> “You can only actually help someone who wants to be helped.”
― Jojo Moyes, Me Before You
> 

> “You are scored on my heart,Clark. You were from the first day you walked in,with your ridiculous clothes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing you felt.”
― Jojo Moyes, Me Before You
> 

> “Shhh. Just listen. You, of all people. Listen to what Im saying. This...tonight...is the most wonderful thing you could have done for me. What you have told me, what you have done in bringing me here...knowing that, somehow, from that complete arse, I was at the start of this, you managed to salvage something to love is astonishing to me. But...I need it to end here. No more chair. No more pneumonia. No more burning limbs. No more pain and tiredness and waking up every morning already wishing it was over. When we get back, I am still going to go to Switzerland. And if you do love me, Clark, as you say you do, the thing that would make me happier than anything is if you would come with me. So I'm asking you - if you feel the things you say you feel - then do it. Be with me. Give me the end I'm hoping for.”

> “I thought, briefly, that I would never feel as intensely connected to the world, to another human being, as I did at that moment.”
