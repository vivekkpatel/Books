# The Kiss Quotient By Helen Hoang

> “If you can’t stand being with a woman who’s more successful than you, then leave her alone. She’s better off without you. If you actually love her, then know the value of that love and make it a promise. That is the only thing she needs from you.”
― Helen Hoang, The Kiss Quotient
> 

> “All the things that make you different make you perfect.”
― Helen Hoang, The Kiss Quotient
> 

> “I don't want just a night or a week or a month with you. I want you all the time. I like you better than calculus, and math is the only thing that unites the universe.”
― Helen Hoang, The Kiss Quotient
> 

> “She didn’t know how to be semi-interested in something. She was either indifferent . . . or obsessed.”
― Helen Hoang, The Kiss Quotient

> “This crusade to fix herself was ending right now. She wasn't broken. She saw and interacted with the world in a different way, but that was her. She could change her actions, change her words, change her appearance, but she couldn't change the root of herself. At her core, she would always be autistic. People called it a disorder, but it didn't feel like one. To her, it was simply the way she was.”

> “Women buy underwear for the men they love. It’s economics. Data supports this claim.”
“Are you telling me you love me, Stella?”
She hugged Karate Bear tight and nodded, suddenly overcome by shyness.
“You’re not going to give me the words?” he asked.
“I’ve never said them to anyone but my parents.”
“You think I run around telling women I love them?”
He pulled her close and pressed their foreheads together.
“I’m going to get the words out of you. Tonight.”

> “Could you say something, please? When a guy tells a girl he loves her, he doesn’t want silence in response. Was I too late? Are you over me?”
> 

> “Are you wearing the underwear I got you?”Laughter cracked out of him. “Sometimes, the way your mind works is a complete mystery to me.”

> “When you loved something, you were good at it. If you weren't good right away, you got good at it.”

> “She put a spoonful of mint chocolate chip in her mouth. [...]
"Let me try it."
She held her bowl toward him, but he didn't put his spoon in it. He trailed his fingers over her jaw as he tipped her head back and sealed his lips over hers. His tongue speared into her mouth, and the salt of him mixed with the flavor of the ice cream. She didn't know if she was mortified, shocked, aroused or all three.”

> “Which was actually one of her main weaknesses, and a defining characteristic of her disorder. She didn’t know how to be semi-interested in something. She was either indifferent . . . or obsessed. And her obsessions weren’t passing things. They consumed her and became a part of her. She kept them close, wove them into her very life. Just like her work.”
