# Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

In his youth Jim has dreams of becoming a writer. he was still dreaming about that until jack childhood. then he started to dream that jack might become writer instead. That's **impossible things for sons to grasp and source of shame for fathers to admit that we don't want our children to pursue our dreams or walk in our footstep's. We want to walk in their footsteps while they peruse our dreams.**

“They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.” 
― Fredrik Backman, Anxious People

“The truth of course is that if people really were as happy as they look on the Internet, they wouldn’t spend so much damn time on the Internet, because no one who’s having a really good day spends half of it taking pictures of themselves. Anyone can nurture a myth about their life if they have enough manure, so if the grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that’s probably because it’s full of shit.” ― Fredrik Backman, Anxious People

“Have you ever held a three-year-old by the hand on the way home from preschool?"

"No." 

"You're never more important that you are then.”

“Something my dad says...He says you end up marrying the one you don't understand. Then you spend the rest of your life trying.” ― Fredrik Backman, Anxious People

"You can't live long with the one with only beautiful Jules, but the funny one last lifetime."
