# The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse by Charlie Mackesy

I hope this book encourages you, perhaps to live courageously with more Kindness for yourself and for others. And to ask for help when you need it which is always a brave things to do.

"What do you think is the biggest waste of time?"
"Comparing yourself to others" said the mole.

"One of our greatest freedom is how we react to things"

"Isn't it odd. We can only see our outside, but nearly everything happens on the inside"

"Being kind to yourself is one of the greatest kindnesses" said the Mole.
"We often wait for kindness, but being kind to yourself can start now" said the Mole.
"Often the hardest person to forgive is yourself"

"What is the bravest thing you've ever said?" asked the boy.
"Help", said the horse."
Asking for help isn't giving up", said the horse.
"It's refusing to give up"

"When have you been at your strongest?" asked the boy.
"When I have dared to show my weakness."

"Sometime just getting up and carrying on is brave and magnificent" said the horse.

"Is your glass half empty or half full?" asked the mole.
"I think I'm grateful to have a glass" said the boy.

"What do we do when our heats hurt?" asked the boy.
"We wrap them with friendship, shared tears and time, till they wake hopeful and happy again."

"Don't measure how valuable you are by the way you are treated" said the horse
"Always remember you matter, you're important and you are loved and you bring to this world things no one else can"

“Is your glass half empty or half full?" asked the mole. "I think I'm grateful to have a glass," said the boy.”
