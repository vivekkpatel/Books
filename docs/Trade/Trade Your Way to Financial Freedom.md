# Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom by Van K Tharp

## Quotes 

> We typically trade our beliefs about the market, and once we’ve made up our minds about those beliefs, we’re not likely to change them. And when we play the markets, we assume that we are considering all of the available information. Instead, our beliefs, through selective perception, may have eliminated the most useful information.

# Biases That Affect How you Trade your system

### Gambler’s fallacy bias

People assum that the probability goes up for a win after long losing streak or up for a loss after long winning system

### Conservative with profits and risky with losses bias

People want to take profits quickly and give their losses some room. This gives them the illusion of being right, but what they are really doing is cutting their profits short and letting their losses run.

### My current trade or investment must be a winner bias

what makes all these problems come ot the forefront is the overwhelming desire of humans being to make current position work out. 

What happens? when you have losing position, you’ll do anything tot nurse it along, hoping it will turn around. As a result, losing trades tends to become even bigger.  Second, people take profits prematurely in order to make sure those profits remain profits.

why? people have overwhelming desire to be right. Over and over again, I hear traders and investors tell me how important it is for them to be right when they make a market prediction or, even worse when they invest their money in market.

Once a person makes prediction, the ego becomes involved in it, making it difficult to accept anything that happens in the process of trading that seems to differ from your prediction. Thus, it becomes very difficult to trade anything that you publicly predict in any way.

### Summary

The amount of information to which the average individual is now exposed doubles every year. consciously, however we can only process about 7 chunks of information before it is lost. As a result we have developed a number of shortcuts or heuristics to help us cope with the vast amount of information to which we are exposed. These heuristics are useful under most circumstances, but their  implications for traders and investors are so strong that my belief is that the average person has no probability of making money in the markets unless he or she deals with them.
