The image on the computer screen showing the blood flowing through the cartridge and settling into the little wells was real. But you never knew whether you were going to get a result or not. So they\u2019d recorded a result from one of the times it worked. It was that recorded result that was displayed at the end of each demo.\u201d \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cWhile Elizabeth was fast to catch on to engineering concepts, Sunny was often out of his depth during engineering discussions. To hide it, he had a habit of repeating technical terms he heard others using. During a meeting with Arnav\u2019s team, he latched onto the term \u201cend effector,\u201d which signifies the claws at the end of a robotic arm. Except Sunny didn\u2019t hear \u201cend effector,\u201d he heard \u201cendofactor.\u201d For the rest of the meeting, he kept referring to the fictional endofactors. At their next meeting with Sunny two weeks later, Arnav\u2019s team brought a PowerPoint presentation titled \u201cEndofactors Update.\u201d As Arnav flashed it on a screen with a projector, the five members of his team stole furtive glances at one another, nervous that Sunny might become wise to the prank. But he didn\u2019t bat an eye and the meeting proceeded without incident. After he left the room, they burst out laughing.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cSunny, in fact, had the master-servant mentality common among an older generation of Indian businessmen.

That, in turn, led to another fateful decision\u2014the decision to cheat.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cWould you rather be smart and poor or dumb and rich? The three engineers all chose smart and poor, while the Frat Pack voted unanimously for dumb and rich. Greg was struck by how clearly the line was drawn between the two groups. They were all in their mid- to late twenties with good educations, but they valued different things.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cA chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cAfter some discussion, the four men {the board] reached a consensus: they would remove Elizabeth as CEO. She had proven herself too young and inexperienced for the job. Tom Brodeen would step in to lead the company for a temporary period until a more permanent replacement could be found. They called in Elizabeth to confront her with what they had learned and inform her of their decision. But then something extraordinary happened. Over the course of the next two hours, Elizabeth convinced them to change their minds.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cthe company was just a vehicle for Elizabeth and Sunny\u2019s romance and that none of the work they did really mattered. Ian nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a folie \u00e0 deux,\u201d he said. Tony didn\u2019t know any French, so he left to go look up the expression in the dictionary. The definition he found struck him as apt: \u201cThe presence of the same or similar delusional ideas in two persons closely associated with one another.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cSunny and Elizabeth\u2019s boldest claim was that the Theranos system was capable of running seventy different blood tests simultaneously on a single finger-stick sample and that it would soon be able to run even more. The ability to perform so many tests on just a drop or two of blood was something of a Holy Grail in the field of microfluidics. Thousands of researchers around the world in universities and industry had been pursuing this goal for more than two decades\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cElizabeth incorporated the company as Real-Time Cures, which an unfortunate typo turned into \u201cReal-Time Curses\u201d on early employees\u2019 paychecks. She later changed the name to Theranos, a combination of the words \u201ctherapy\u201d and \u201cdiagnosis.\u201d \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cOn February 4, 2014, Partner Fund purchased 5,655,294 Theranos shares at a price of \\(17 a share\u2014\\)2 a share more than the Lucas Venture Group had paid just four months earlier. The investment brought in another $96 million to Theranos\u2019s coffers and valued it at a stunning $9 billion. This meant that Elizabeth, who owned slightly more than half of the company, now had a net worth of almost $5 billion.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cWhat if the Theranos technology did turn out to be game-changing? It might spend the next decade regretting passing up on it. The fear of missing out was a powerful deterrent.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cIan also had issues with Elizabeth\u2019s management, especially the way she siloed the groups off from one another and discouraged them from communicating. The reason she and Sunny invoked for this way of operating was that Theranos was \u201cin stealth mode,\u201d but it made no sense to Ian. At the other diagnostics companies where he had worked, there had always been cross-functional teams with representatives from the chemistry, engineering, manufacturing, quality control, and regulatory departments working toward a common objective. That was how you got everyone on the same page, solved problems, and met deadlines.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cThe resignations infuriated Elizabeth and Sunny. The following day, they summoned the staff for an all-hands meeting in the cafeteria. Copies of The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho\u2019s famous novel about an Andalusian shepherd boy who finds his destiny by going on a journey to Egypt, had been placed on every chair. Still visibly angry, Elizabeth told the gathered employees that she was building a religion. If there were any among them who didn\u2019t believe, they should leave. Sunny put it more bluntly: anyone not prepared to show complete devotion and unmitigated loyalty to the company should \u201cget the fuck out.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cThe odds that Holmes could pull off this latest Houdini act while under criminal investigation were very long, but watching her confidently walk the audience through her sleek slide show helped crystallize for me how she\u2019d gotten this far: she was an amazing saleswoman. She never once stumbled or lost her train of thought. She wielded both engineering and laboratory lingo effortlessly and she showed seemingly heartfelt emotion when she spoke of sparing babies in the NICU from blood transfusions. Like her idol Steve Jobs, she emitted a reality distortion field that forced people to momentarily suspend disbelief.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cToward the end she boasted, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d adding after a brief pause, \u201cexcept needles.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cSure, Mark Zuckerberg had learned to code on his father\u2019s computer when he was ten, but medicine was different: it wasn\u2019t something you could teach yourself in the basement of your house.\u201d  \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201cHer emergence tapped into the public\u2019s hunger to see a female entrepreneur break through in a technology world dominated by men. Women like Yahoo\u2019s Marissa Mayer and Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg had achieved a measure of renown in Silicon Valley, but they hadn\u2019t created their own companies from scratch. In Elizabeth Holmes, the Valley had its first female billionaire tech founder.\u201d \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p> <p>\u201che bragged that he\u2019d written a million lines of code. Some employees thought that was preposterous. Sunny had worked at Microsoft, where teams of software engineers had written the Windows operating system at the rate of one thousand lines of code per year of development. Even if you assumed Sunny was twenty times faster than the Windows developers, it would still have taken him fifty years to do what he claimed.\u201d \u2015 John Carreyrou, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</p>"},{"location":"Biography/Bricklin%20on%20Technology.html","title":"Bricklin on Technology by Dan Bricklin","text":"<p>People in different fields of endeavor are often motivated by different drives.

You\u2019re assuming that no one, including yourself, might object to revealing to anyone information about their religious beliefs, political affiliations and sexual activities, as casually as some choose to reveal their movie and music tastes and reading preferences.

This fact alone virtually guaranteed technological tyranny, which was perpetuated not by the technology itself but by the ignorance of everyone who used it daily and yet failed to understand it. To refuse to inform yourself about the basic operation and maintenance of the equipment you depended on was to passively accept that tyranny and agree to its terms: when your equipment works, you\u2019ll work, but when your equipment breaks down you\u2019ll break down, too.

Yes, sometimes, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to change my client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind-set. But it starts with me, first, just as it starts with you. You have to forget selling time.

But over time I established myself and my credibility, which led to great references. When that happens, you begin to outgrow the cost-plus pricing model of charging by the hour. So if you stay with that pricing model, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find it very limiting.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153since there are only so many hours in a year, it puts a cap on how much revenue you can collect in a year, and it means that the only way to make more money is to work more hours. These are limits\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and the truth is, they are false limitations that lead to bad behaviors, like burning yourself out by working around the clock in an effort to earn more.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Selling hours actually creates a conflict of interest. It puts you and the client on opposite sides of the table. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re selling hours, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in your best interest to take longer, to bill more hours. But your client is interested in getting solutions that work as promptly as possible. What if you work quicker for one client than another, but deliver the same value? Should you penalize the client you worked longer for? If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re slow, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not their fault.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Right. Our clients don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about our costs. They care about the value we create for them, so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we should be asking them to pay for. But just because my clients don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about my costs, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I do care, very much. Which is why I see it as my job to look for ways to create value for my clients so that I can charge fees that more than cover my costs, making my business profitable.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our clients don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about our costs.

Most people are fine with that. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re desperate to know a ballpark, I might give them a range, but I really resist that. I find that prospects who focus on price right away often turn out to be the kind of client you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want anyway. The best thing I can do for the client is to help them explore what they want. And it turns out, this initial conversation about their problem is the foundation of my approach to pricing.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d</p>"},{"location":"Business/Breaking%20the%20Time%20Barrier.html#the-seven-mutual-benefits-of-exploring-value-with-your-clients","title":"The seven mutual benefits of exploring value with your clients","text":""},{"location":"Business/Breaking%20the%20Time%20Barrier.html#creates-trust","title":"Creates trust","text":"<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I start off by asking my clients probing questions, they see that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m interested in understanding their unique problems and crafting solutions based on what I learn. That inspires trust because they know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not trying to push cookiecutter stuff that I force on everyone.

And as you know, having the most competitive rate doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always work in your favor. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because low prices can create the perception of low value.

Because I dig in and come to understand the problems my clients have, I design solutions that are more strategic. I wind up taking a different and more impactful approach to what on the surface can sometimes seem like the same project. So my clients may pay more for my services, but they get more too.

This is typically Western of us, preferring analysis (breaking apart) over synthesis (putting together) and understanding the world in terms of\u00a0modular mechanisms instead of holistic organisms. Thinking of habits in isolation not only misses much of the rich context that characterizes human behavior, it also happens to be absolutely exhausting. You can build a few habits using the \u201chighly targeted, analytical, structured\u201d approach, but as soon as you try to scale you run into plummeting and then negative returns.</p> <p>The problem is that when I really ask myself \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I have a healthy lunch today?\u201d, it usually isn\u2019t a faulty trigger, a lackluster reward, or flaws in any of the dozen supporting strategies I\u2019ve researched and taught. It\u2019s usually because I didn\u2019t have a filling, healthy breakfast. And that was because I didn\u2019t get up early enough. And that was because I went to bed late. And that was because I worked late, because I didn\u2019t get enough done that day, because I didn\u2019t have enough energy, because\u2026I didn\u2019t have a healthy lunch. In other words, the answer seems to often be \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t do\u00a0other\u00a0habits.\u201d Each habit seems to loop back onto itself, influencing and being influenced by many other habits in complex, interrelated patterns. I see the same phenomenon at work with the people I teach and coach. If it was a simple loop then this would be a simple problem, just a matter of snapping the vicious cycle into a virtuous one. Classic strategies like \u201cDon\u2019t break the chain\u201d and \u201cNever miss two days in a row\u201d attempt to do exactly that. But it\u2019s not a simple loop.

For example, \u201cDoes waking up by 8am directly and unequivocally make meditation more likely to happen?\u201d If the answer was yes (based on my subjective experience), this was counted as a positive one-way relationship. I worded this question in black-and-white terms because I wanted to avoid subtle, global effects (such as meditation increasing my overall willpower, thus making all my other habits more likely to happen). I was looking for direct, unquestionable influences. I then used the 56 positive relationships I came up with to produce the following habit graph: Red are morning habits, green are daytime habits, and blue are nighttime habits (for those reading on non-color devices, moving clockwise from 12 noon, the first 7 habits are morning, the next 2 are daytime, and the last 2 are nighttime habits) Note that the habits are in chronological order moving clockwise, and that relationships can run in one direction or be bidirectional. At this point I could simply create a ranking based on how many other habits each habit supports. But this isn\u2019t quite enough. I want to know not only the absolute number of other habits each one supports, but how influential these supported habits are themselves. In other words, what makes a habit important is not only that it supports many habits, but that it supports habits that are themselves important. This is where eigenvector centrality comes in. Launch the Eigenvector!</p> <p>Although the visualization is helpful, the eigenvector equation allows us to rank the habits according to their influence on the entire network in a way that is not apparent visually. Here\u2019s the relevant equation: Centrality / CC BY-SA Applying this equation to my habit graph, I came up with the following eigenvector centralities. The eigenvector number in purple next to each habit measures that habit\u2019s \u201cinfluence\u201d on the network as a whole: My habits labeled with eigenvector scores This graph shows quite clearly that my most influential habits happen first thing in the morning, and in the evening (mostly, I imagine, because of their strong influence on subsequent morning habits). Here\u2019s a radial version, highlighting even more clearly that early waking is the critical \u201cnode\u201d in my habit network.

It could give you strategies that have worked for other people with similar habit graphs. If you wanted to eliminate a bad habit, it could suggest ways of destabilizing the supporting network around it, instead of attempting a frontal attack in isolation. Understanding the topology of a single human being\u2019s behavior would be the first step toward personalized behavior change, just as genome sequencing is the first step toward personalized medicine.

What, in fact, would we use a second brain\u00a0for? I want to dispel a myth:\u00a0It\u2019s not just \u201cremembering things.\u201d\u00a0Our brains are not particularly good at that anyway, so having a second one wouldn\u2019t help much.

What the brain does best is\u00a0thinking.\u00a0Evernote is most valuable not as a remembering tool, but as a\u00a0thinking\u00a0tool.</p> <p>We\u00a0learned\u00a0in the New York Times recently that storing a\u00a0single human brain\u2019s connectome (the complete map of all neurons and the interconnections between them) would take half the planet\u2019s digital storage capacity: 1.3\u00a0billion terabytes. In other words, to store\u00a0just\u00a0a static map of the physical brain structure of two individuals would require\u00a0100% of global storage capacity. And that\u2019s just the structure, not counting any actual processing. We only have the roughest idea of what that would require, but last year the world\u2019s 4th most powerful supercomputer took\u00a040 minutes to simulate just 1 second of 1%\u00a0of a brain\u2019s activity. So, we\u2019re not even close.</p> <p>A tool like Evernote doesn\u2019t add much value performing low-level tasks like \u201cremembering things,\u201d and it\u2019s incapable of performing high-level creative thinking, what is it good for? My proposal: </p> <p>Mid-level thinking that interfaces between low-level memory and high-level creativity, making the latter as easy, fast, and efficient as\u00a0possible</p> <p>creativity is connecting things,\u00a0especially things that don\u2019t seem to be connected. </p> <p>\u201ccreative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Richard Feynman put it best: </p> <p>\u201cYou have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result,\u00a0test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, \u201cHow did he do it? He must be a genius!\u201d </p> <p>A big part of the problem is that, as\u00a0Cal Newport says, \u201cknowledge workers dedicate too much time to\u00a0shallow work\u200a\u2014\u200atasks that almost anyone, with a minimum of training, could accomplish.\u201d His solution is straightforward, if not exactly actionable: \u201cWe need to spend more time engaged in\u00a0deep work\u200a\u2014\u200acognitively demanding activities that leverage our training to generate\u00a0rare and valuable results.\u201d</p> <p>But just try ignoring this \u201cshallow work\u201d (email, meetings, etc.) for a couple days and see what happens. The solution is suggested by another\u00a0study, seeking to identify which kinds of jobs best survived the technological replacement of the last tech boom. What they found was interesting: it wasn\u2019t jobs requiring advanced skills, or comprehensive knowledge, or years of training that fared best. It was jobs that required the ability to convey \u201cnot just information but a\u00a0particular interpretation\u00a0of information.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, the jobs that seem to best resist technological unemployment are those that involve\u00a0building, maintaining, promoting, and defending a particular perspective. Think of a salesperson citing past results to close a sale. Or a researcher using data to back up their interpretation of an experiment. Or a project manager citing a couple key precedents to support a decision. All these perspectives can benefit from a repository of supporting information. And here\u2019s where a tool like Evernote comes in. Because defending a perspective takes\u00a0ammunition. And by ammunition, I mean\u00a0examples, illustrations, stories, statistics, diagrams, analogies, metaphors, photos, mindmaps, conversation notes, quotes, book notes\u200a\u2014\u200athese are the kinds of things you should be capturing. The more raw material you have to work with, and the more diverse your sources are, the stronger and more original your argument will be.</p> <p>\u201cParticipants in a famous study were given four biased decks of cards\u200a\u2014\u200asome that would win them money, and some that would cause them to lose. When they started the game, they didn\u2019t know that the decks were biased. As they played the game, though, people\u2019s bodies started showing signs of physical \u201cstress\u201d when their conscious minds were about to use a money-losing deck. The stress was an automatic response that occurred because\u00a0the intuitive mind realized something was wrong\u200a\u2014\u200along before the conscious mind realized anything was amiss.\u201d Their conclusion: \u201cOur intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without our conscious awareness.\u201d Misdirected optimization is the root of all\u00a0evil Knowing what secondary thinking functions we need Evernote to help us with is a good first step, but since they still require our involvement, we need to perform them as efficiently as possible. Efficiency is a function of inputs and outputs. So the next question we need to answer is, \u201cWhat is our most scarce resource?\u201d Or in other words: What are we optimizing for? This turns out to be a fairly profound question, with radical implications for how we organize the information in our lives. To illustrate:</p> <p>Loading and Unloading What then is the main cognitive barrier to comparing two ideas? It\u2019s the\u00a0process of \u201cloading\u201d an idea into your brain. Initially this takes a considerable amount of time, as we consume close to 100% of the material to get the 5\u201310% (at most) that is actually valuable. The problem comes when we step away from our desks, promptly forgetting (\u201cunloading\u201d) the superstructure of ideas we\u2019re holding in our short-term memory, since we don\u2019t make any effort to preserve the thinking that was done. This is best illustrated by the experience of putting a complex project aside, and only returning to it months later. The relevant ideas are no longer in RAM, and it takes you\u00a0a lot\u00a0of time/energy to get \u201cback to speed.\u201d On the other hand, think of the immersion you feel after spending a couple solid hours on a problem, where you have all the main ideas at your mental fingertips. Think about the investment reaching this state of mind entails. It\u2019s not just your years of education and training, your vast store of work and life experiences, the effort of managing stress, nutrition, exercise, sleep, etc. so that you\u2019re functioning at your best. We could consider all that your \u201cadministrative overhead.\u201d</p> <p>Returning to Cal Newport: \u201c\u2026Unlike every other skilled labor class in the history of skilled labor,\u00a0[knowledge workers] lack a culture of systematic improvement.\u201d And it\u2019s true. If we consider these periods of intense, focused work as our primary asset as knowledge workers, and think about how precious few hours of quality attention we have to spend each week, and how few weeks and years we have on this planet to make something that matters, it is unforgivable that we make no effort to build a\u00a0knowledge base that appreciates over time. Each day we start again from scratch, trading something invaluable for something merely valuable.</p> <p>The value of a note corresponds to how much attention you\u2019ve spent on\u00a0it In an economy where attention really is currency, the\u00a0value of a note is based on how much attention has been invested in it. In the same way that the price of a physical product is based on the cost of goods that have been invested in it.</p> <p>This in turn suggests an entirely new purpose for Evernote: A system for tracking how much attention has been paid to a given\u00a0note</p> <p>My conclusion was that the global structure of Evernote\u2019s notebooks and stacks is relatively unimportant. I keep notebooks just specific enough to make it obvious where a particular note belongs, mostly to satisfy my organizational itch. The most salient factor in making ideas accessible for day-to-day use is instead the\u00a0design of individual notes. Let me give you a tangible example\u00a0based on this note: 1. I originally clipped this\u00a0Amazon product page, reminding me that I wanted to read this book. Almost no attention was spent, so the value of this note is 1 on a scale of 1\u201310 2. A couple months later, when I had some free time, I read the book, highlighting the parts I thought were most interesting in the Kindle app and exporting them (I use\u00a0Bookcision\u00a0for Kindle or the built-in \u201cShare to Evernote\u201d feature in iBooks and Pocket) to the note. Some time and attention were applied, so its value is now 4, although it\u2019s still too much information to \u201cload\u201d quickly 3. A few weeks later, I reviewed this note and spent some time re-reading my notes, bolding the most insightful and unique sections. Value now equals 7, as I can much more quickly assimilate the key points by scanning only the bolded sections 4. Some time later, when I started a project drawing on this area, I reviewed\u00a0only the bolded parts\u00a0and highlighted (using Evernote\u2019s separate highlighting feature, in yellow) only the very most important parts, leaving me with only\u00a015 highlighted sections from a whole book. Considerable time and attention has now been applied, and it would be difficult to justify this \u201cexpense\u201d if the results of my thinking were not stored in a durable, easily loadable format. Note that as the total amount of content highlighted has dwindled, it has become much easier to quickly grasp its key points, increasing its value proportionally to 10 This note has now become a\u00a0potent information weapon, its ideas and facts ready to be used in a wide variety of future contexts, at a moment\u2019s notice.</p> <p>Comprehensiveness\u00a0values knowing all the facts. It is the voice in your head that says, \u201cProve it.\u201d It wants more data, and examples, and cited sources. It is the fear that you\u2019ll remember the main point, but forget why it matters. It helps us not let anything fall through the cracks, but also drives us toward packrat insanity. The way to balance these competing priorities is to: Progressively summarize\u00a0the most important points of a source in small stages (compression), and\u2026 Preserve each of these stages in\u00a0layers\u00a0that can be peeled back on demand (comprehensiveness). Basically, you need to be able to quickly assimilate the main points of a source to evaluate its relevance to the task at hand, while simultaneously preserving the ability to quickly \u201cgo deeper\u201d into the source if you judge it to be highly relevant. But even this \u201cgoing deeper\u201d must be staged, because you want to avoid creating a black-or-white, all-or-nothing choice between reading just a few key points, or having to go back and re-read the entire original source.</p> <p>Most notes will fall somewhere on a spectrum of relevance, and you want to be able to calibrate the corresponding time you spend \u201cloading\u201d them. This layering turns a note from a\u00a0dense, impenetrable jungle into a rocky landscape: Mt. Everest from Space / NASA Sometimes you want to do a high-elevation flyover, seeing only the highest peaks. Other times you want to explore the middle ranges by helicopter, perhaps identifying stories or juicy factoids to illustrate a point. And sometimes, you want to parachute in and hack your way through the underbrush, poring over each source and following every rabbit trail. Designing your note in easily uncoverable layers is like giving yourself a\u00a0digital map of the terrain that can be zoomed in or out to any level of detail you need. You\u2019re creating an environment in which your \u201cradar\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ayour semi-conscious, rapid scanning ability to recognize complex patterns and non-obvious connections intuitively \u2014works to maximum effect.</p>"},{"location":"Business/Design%20Your%20Work.html#self-organizing","title":"Self Organizing","text":"<p>I said previously that the purpose of Evernote is to \u201ctrack how much attention has been paid to a given note.\u201d But even this tracking shouldn\u2019t be done explicitly.

The last thing you want to do is put every single note through multiple layers of compression. That is a terrible waste of attention. Instead,\u00a0customize the level of compression\u00a0based on how intuitively important the source is to your work. I would guess my personal breakdown, with about 2,300 notes, is approximately as follows: 1 layer of compression (saving any notes on the source): 50% 2 layers (bolding the best parts): 25% 3 layers (highlighting the very best parts): 20% 4 layers or more (restating the ideas in my own words, applying them to my own context, creating summary outlines, etc.): 5% or less Although less than 5% of the sources I save go through more than 3 layers of compression, these sources are more valuable to me than all the rest put together.

He works hard to be a good provider for his wife and children. He spends long hours at the office and brings work home on weekends. One day he comes home to an empty house. His wife has left with the kids. He knew he and his wife had problems, but rather than work to make the relationship strong, he stayed busy at work. Dismayed, his performance at work slips and he loses his job. Today, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their wealth. And there are people too busy to take care of their health. The cause is the same. They\u2019re busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding something they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep down they know. In fact, if you remind them, they often respond with anger or irritation. If they aren\u2019t busy at work or with the kids, they\u2019re often busy watching TV, fishing, playing golf, or shopping.

Choices are at the root of every one of your results. Each choice starts a behaviour that over time becomes a habit.

Don\u2019t choose at all and you\u2019ve actually made the choice to be the passive receiver of whatever comes your way.</p> <p>In essence, you make your choices and then your choices make you. Every decision, no matter how slight, alters the trajectory of your life, whether or not to go to college, whom to marry, to have that last drink before you drive, to indulge in gossip or stay silent, to make one more prospecting call or call it a day, to say I love you or let the moment pass by. Every choice has an impact on the compound effect of your life.</p> <p>Your biggest challenge isn\u2019t that you\u2019ve intentionally been making bad choices. Heck, that would be easy to fix.

You must make a commitment of money, time, love, something. That is the law of the universe. Except by blind change, it cannot be circumvented.

It means wanting more than you came in for or more than you have a right to expect. It means losing control of your desire.</p> <p>This axiom also illustrates the original meaning of the popular saying \u201cDon\u2019t push your luck\u201d.

It deserves more careful study than it usually gets. </p> <p>In the course of gambling or speculative play, you will from time to time enjoy streaks and runs of luck. you will enjoy them so much that you will want to ride them forever and ever. Undoubtedly you will have the good sense to recognize that they cannot last forever, but if greed has you in its grip, you will talk yourself into hoping or believing that they will at least last a long time and then a bit longer and the little longer. And so you will ride and ride, and in the end you and your money will go over the falls. </p> <p>The point to be appreciated is that you cannot know in advance how long a given winning streak is going to last.

Tagged data means that each data element in the file is preceded by an integer number that is called a group code. A group code's value indicates what type of data element follows. This value also indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object (or record) type. Virtually all user-specified information in a drawing file can be represented in DXF format.\u201d</p> <p>Object and Entity Codes </p> <p>In the DXF\u2122 format, the definition of objects differs from entities: objects have no graphical representation and entities do. For example, dictionaries are objects, and not entities.</p> <p>Entities are also referred to as graphical objects while objects are referred to as nongraphical objects. Entities appear in both the BLOCK and ENTITIES sections of the DXF file. The use of group codes in the two sections is identical. Some group codes that define an entity always appear; others are optional and appear only if their values differ from the defaults. Do not write programs that rely on the order given here. The end of an entity is indicated by the next 0 group, which begins the next entity or indicates the end of the section.</p>  **\ud83d\udca1 Accommodating DXF files from future releases of AutoCAD\u00ae will be easier if you write your DXF processing program in a table-driven way, ignore undefined group codes, and make no assumptions about the order of group codes in an entity. With each new AutoCAD release, new group codes will be added to entities to accommodate additional features.**   <p>HEADER Section</p> <p>The HEADER section of a DXF file contains the settings of variables associated with the drawing. Each variable is specified by a 9 group code giving the variable's name, followed by groups that supply the variable's value.</p> <p>CLASSES Section</p> <p>The CLASSES section holds the information for application-defined classes whose instances appear in the BLOCKS, ENTITIES, and OBJECTS sections of the database. It is assumed that a class definition is permanently fixed in the class hierarchy. All fields are required.</p> <p>TABLES Section</p> <p>The TABLES section contains several tables, each of which can contain a variable number of entries.</p> <p>The order of the tables may change, but the LTYPE table always precedes the LAYER table. Each table is introduced with a 0 group code with the label TABLE. This is followed by a 2 group code identifying the particular table (APPID, DIMSTYLE, LAYER, LTYPE, STYLE, UCS, VIEW, VPORT, or BLOCK_RECORD).</p> <p>The tables in a drawing can contain deleted items, but these are not written to the DXF file. As a result, fewer table entries may follow the table header than are indicated by the 70 group code, so do not use the count in the 70 group code as an index to read in the table. This group code is provided so that a program that reads DXF files can allocate an array large enough to hold all the table entries that follow. Following this header for each table are the table entries. Each table entry consists of a 0 group identifying the item type (same as table name, such as LTYPE or LAYER), a 2 group giving the name of the table entry, a 70 group specifying flags relevant to the table entry (defined for each following table), and additional groups that give the value of the table entry. The end of each table is indicated by a 0 group with the value ENDTAB.</p> <p>BLOCKS Section</p> <p>The BLOCKS section contains an entry for each block reference in the drawing.</p> <p>The BLOCKS section of the DXF file contains all the block definitions, including anonymous blocks generated by the HATCH command and by associative dimensioning. Each block definition contains the entities that make up that block as it is used in the drawing. The format of the entities in this section is identical to those in the ENTITIES section. All entities in the BLOCKS section appear between block and endblk entities.</p> <p>External references are written in the DXF file as block definitions, except that they also include a string (group code 1) that specifies the path and file name of the external reference.</p> <p>ENTITIES Section</p> <p>This chapter presents the group codes that apply to graphical objects</p> <p>NOTE : Do not write programs that rely on the order shown in these DXF code tables. Although these tables show the order of group codes as they usually appear, the order can change under certain conditions or may be changed in a future AutoCAD\u00ae release. The code that controls an entity should be driven by a case (switch) or a table so that it can process each group correctly even if the order is unexpected.</p> <p>OBJECTS Section</p> <p>This chapter presents the group codes that apply to nongraphical objects.</p> <p>Objects are similar to entities, except that they have no graphical or geometric meaning. All objects that are not entities or symbol table records or symbol tables are stored in this section.

The formats presented are Drawing Interchange File (DXF\u2122), binary DXF, Slide (SLD), and the Slide Library (SLB) file formats.</p> <p>DXF files can be either ASCII or binary format. Because ASCII DXF files are more common than the binary format, the term DXF file is used to refer to ASCII DXF files and the term binary DXF file is used for the binary format</p> <p>ASCII DXF Files </p> <p>This section describes the format of ASCII DXF files. It contains information that is needed only if you write your own programs to process DXF files or work with entity information obtained by AutoLISP\u00ae and ObjectARX\u00ae applications.</p> <p>Essentially, a DXF file is composed of pairs of codes and associated values. The codes, known as group codes, indicate the type of value that follows. Using these group code and value pairs, a DXF file is organized into sections composed of records, which are composed of a group code and a data item. Each group code and value are on their own line in the DXF file.</p> <p>Each section starts with a group code 0 followed by the string SECTION. This is followed by a group code 2 and a string indicating the name of the section (for example, HEADER). Each section is composed of group codes and values that define its elements. A section ends with a 0 followed by the string ENDSEC.</p> <p>The overall organization of a DXF file is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>HEADER section. Contains general information about the drawing. It consists of an AutoCAD database version number and a number of system variables. Each parameter contains a variable name and its associated value.</li> <li>CLASSES section. Holds the information for application-defined classes, whose instances appear in the BLOCKS, ENTITIES, and OBJECTS sections of the database. A class definition is permanently fixed in class hierarchy.</li> <li>TABLES section. Contains definitions for the following symbol tables: APPID (application identification table) BLOCK_RECORD (block reference table) DIMSTYLE (dimension style table) LAYER (layer table) LTYPE (linetype table) STYLE (text style table) UCS (user coordinate system table) VIEW (view table) VPORT (viewport configuration table)</li> <li>BLOCKS section. Contains block definition and drawing entities that make up each block reference in the drawing.</li> <li>ENTITIES section. Contains the graphical objects (entities) in the drawing, including block references (insert entities).</li> <li>OBJECTS section. Contains the nongraphical objects in the drawing. All objects that are not entities or symbol table records or symbol tables are stored in this section. Examples of entries in the OBJECTS section are dictionaries that contain mline styles and groups.</li> <li>THUMBNAILIMAGE section. Contains the preview image data for the drawing.

In .NET parlance, this is called disposal, and it is supported through the `IDisposable` interface. The managed memory occupied by unused objects must also be reclaimed at some point; this function is known as garbage collection and is performed by the CLR.\n\nDisposal differs from garbage collection in that disposal is usually explicitly instiga\u2010 ted; garbage collection is totally automatic. In other words, the programmer takes care of such things as releasing file handles, locks, and operating system resources while the CLR takes care of releasing memory.\n\nThis chapter discusses both disposal and garbage collection, also describing C# finalizers and the pattern by which they can provide a backup for disposal.\n\n# IDisposable, Dispose, and Close\n\nThe .NET Core defines a special interface for types requiring a tear-down method\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IDisposable\n{\n void Dispose();\n}\n</code></pre> <p>C#\u2019s using statement provides a syntactic shortcut for calling Dispose on objects that implement IDisposable, using a try/finally block:</p> <pre><code>using (FileStream fs = new FileStream (\"myFile.txt\", FileMode.Open))\n{\n // ... Write to the file ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The compiler converts this to the following</p> <pre><code>FileStream fs = new FileStream (\"myFile.txt\", FileMode.Open);\ntry\n{\n // ... Write to the file ...\n}\nfinally\n{\n if (fs != null) ((IDisposable)fs).Dispose();\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In simple scenarios, writing your own disposable type is just a matter of implementing IDisposable and writing the Dispose method:</p> <pre><code>sealed class Demo : IDisposable\n{\n public void Dispose()\n {\n // Perform cleanup / tear-down.\n ...\n }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Code/C%23%208%20%20in%20Nutshell%20Summary.html#standard-disposal-semantics","title":"Standard Disposal Semantics","text":"<p>.NET Core follows a de facto set of rules in its disposal logic.

If you use [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core or Web API, .NET Core does this for you automatically. However, you still need to be aware of shared state (for instance, the effect of using static variables for caching).\n\n- Parallel programming\n\n    Code that performs intensive calculations can execute faster on multicore/ multiprocessor computers if the workload is divided between cores\n\n- Speculative execution\n\n    On multicore machines, you can sometimes improve performance by predicting something that might need to be done and then doing it ahead of time. LINQPad uses this technique to speed up the creation of new queries. A variation is to run a number of different algorithms in parallel that all solve the same task. Whichever one finishes first \u201cwins\u201d this is effective when you can\u2019t know ahead of time which algorithm will execute fastest.\n\n\n# Threading\n\nA thread is an execution path that can **proceed independently of others**.\n\nEach thread runs within an operating system process, which provides an isolated environment in which a program runs. With a single-threaded program, just one thread runs in the process\u2019s isolated environment and so that thread has exclusive access to it. **With a multithreaded program, multiple threads run in a single process, sharing the same execution environment** (memory, in particular). This, in part, is why multithreading is useful: one thread can fetch data in the background, for instance, while another thread displays the data as it arrives. This data is referred to as shared state.\n\n## Creating a Thread\n\nA client program (Console, WPF, UWP, or Windows Forms) starts in a single thread that\u2019s created automatically by the OS (the \u201cmain\u201d thread). Here it lives out its life as a single-threaded application, unless you do otherwise, by creating more threads\n\nYou can create and start a new thread by instantiating a Thread object and calling its Start method. The simplest constructor for Thread takes a ThreadStart delegate: a parameterless method indicating where execution should begin.\n\n```csharp\n// NB: All samples in this chapter assume the following namespace imports:\nusing System;\nusing System.Threading;\nclass ThreadTest\n{\n static void Main()\n {\n Thread t = new Thread (WriteY); // Kick off a new thread\n t.Start(); // running WriteY()\n // Simultaneously, do something on the main thread.\n for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) Console.Write (\"x\");Thread.Sleep(100);}\n static void WriteY()\n {\n for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) Console.Write (\"y\");Thread.Sleep(100);\n }\n}\n// Typical Output:\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyyy\nyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy\nyyyyyyyyyyyyyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The main thread creates a new thread t on which it runs a method that repeatedly prints the character y. Simultaneously, the main thread repeatedly prints the character x, as shown in Figure 14-1. On a single-core computer, the operating system must allocate \u201cslices\u201d of time to each thread (typically 20 ms in Windows) to simulate concurrency, resulting in repeated blocks of x and y. On a multicore or multiprocessor machine, the two threads can genuinely execute in parallel (subject to competition by other active processes on the computer), although you still get repeated blocks of x and y in this example because of subtleties in the mechanism by which Console handles concurrent requests.</p> <p>After it\u2019s started, a thread\u2019s IsAlive property returns true, until the point at which the thread ends. A thread ends when the delegate passed to the Thread\u2019s constructor finishes executing.

This is particularly useful in Visual Studio because the thread\u2019s name is displayed in the Threads Window and Debug Location toolbar.

An assembly contains compiled types with their IL code, runtime resources, and information to assist with versioning and referencing other assemblies. An assembly also defines a boundary for type resolution. In .NET Core, an assembly comprises a single file with a .dll extension.\n\nWhen you build an executable application in .NET Core, you end up with two files: an assembly (.dll) and an executable launcher (.exe) appropriate to the platform you\u2019re targeting. \n\nThis differs to what happens in .NET Framework, which generates a portable executable (PE) assembly. A PE has an .exe extension and acts both as an assembly and an application launcher. A PE can simultaneously target 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows.\n\nMost of the types in this chapter come from the following namespaces\n\n```csharp\nSystem.Reflection\nSystem.Resources\nSystem.Globalization\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Code/C%23%208%20%20in%20Nutshell%20Summary.html#whats-in-an-assembly","title":"What\u2019s in an Assembly","text":"<ul> <li> <p>An assembly manifest</p> <p>Provides information to the CLR, such as the assembly\u2019s name, version, and other assemblies that it references</p> </li> <li> <p>An application manifest</p> <p>Provides information to the operating system, such as how the assembly should be deployed and whether administrative elevation is required</p> </li> <li> <p>Compiled types</p> <p>The compiled IL code and metadata of the types defined within the assembly</p> </li> <li> <p>Resources</p> <p>Other data embedded within the assembly, such as images and localizable text</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Code/C%23%208%20%20in%20Nutshell%20Summary.html#the-assembly-manifest","title":"The Assembly Manifest","text":"<p>The assembly manifest serves two purposes</p> <ul> <li>It describes the assembly to the managed hosting environment.</li> <li>It acts as a directory to the modules, types, and resources in the assembly.</li> </ul> <p>Assemblies are thus self-describing.

Rather, it\u2019s a library that sits atop the CLR**\u2014just like any other library such as System.Xml.dll. Its primary role is to provide runtime services to unify dynamic programming\u2014in both statically and dynamically typed languages. Hence, languages such as C#, Visual Basic, IronPython, and IronRuby all use the same protocol for calling functions dynamically. This allows them to share libraries and call code written in other languages.\n\n# Numeric Type Unification\n\n```csharp\nstatic dynamic Mean (dynamic x, dynamic y) =&gt; (x + y) / 2;\nstatic void Main()\n{\n int x = 3, y = 5;\n Console.WriteLine (Mean (x, y));\n}\n</code></pre> <p>However, this (unnecessarily) sacrifices static type safety. The following compiles without error but then fails at runtime:</p> <pre><code>string s = Mean (3, 5); // Runtime error!\n</code></pre> <p>We can fix this by introducing a generic type parameter and then casting to dynamic within the calculation itself:</p> <pre><code>static T Mean&lt;T&gt; (T x, T y)\n{\n dynamic result = ((dynamic) x + y) / 2;\n return (T) result;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Dynamic binding incurs a small performance hit\u2014even with call-site caching. You can mitigate this by adding statically typed overloads that cover just the most com\u2010 monly used types. For example, if subsequent performance profiling showed that calling Mean with doubles was a bottleneck, you could add the following overload:</p> <pre><code>static double Mean (double x, double y) =&gt; (x + y) / 2;\n</code></pre> <p>The compiler will favor that overload when Mean is called with arguments that are known at compile time to be of type double.</p>"},{"location":"Code/C%23%208%20%20in%20Nutshell%20Summary.html#implementing-dynamic-objects","title":"Implementing Dynamic Objects","text":"<p>An object can provide its binding semantics by implementing IDynamicMetaObject Provider\u2014or more easily by subclassing DynamicObject, which provides a default implementation of this interface.

Unless other\u2010 wise stated, the types mentioned in this chapter exist in either the System or the `System.Runtime.InteropServices` namespace.\n\n# COM Interoperability\n\nThe .NET runtime provides special support for COM, enabling COM objects to be used from .NET, and vice versa. COM is available only on Windows.\n\n## The Purpose of COM\n\nCOM is an acronym for **Component Object Model**, a binary standard for interfacing with libraries, released by Microsoft in 1993. The **motivation for inventing COM was to enable components to communicate with one another in a language independent and version-tolerant manner.** Before COM, the approach in Windows was to publish DLLs that declared structures and functions using the C programming language. Not only is this approach language specific, but it\u2019s also brittle. The specification of a type in such a library is inseparable from its implementation: even updating a structure with a new field means breaking its specification.\n\nThe beauty of COM was to separate the specification of a type from its underlying implementation through a construct known as a COM interface. COM also allowed for the calling of methods on stateful objects\u2014rather than being limited to simple procedure calls.\n\n**In a way, the .NET programming model is an evolution of the principles of COM programming: the .NET platform also facilitates cross-language development and allows binary components to evolve without breaking applications that depend on them.**\n\n## The Basics of the COM Type System\n\nThe COM type system revolves around interfaces. A COM interface is rather like a .NET interface, but it\u2019s more prevalent because a COM type exposes its functional\u2010 ity only through an interface. In the .NET world, for instance, we could declare a type simply, as follows:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Foo\n{\n public string Test() =&gt; \"Hello, world\";\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Consumers of that type can use Foo directly. And if we later changed the implementation of Test(), calling assemblies would not require recompilation. In this respect, .NET separates interface from implementation\u2014without requiring inter\u2010 faces. We could even add an overload without breaking callers:</p> <pre><code>public string Test (string s) =&gt; $\"Hello, world {s}\";\n</code></pre> <p>In the COM world, Foo exposes its functionality through an interface to achieve this same decoupling. So, in Foo\u2019s type library, an interface such as this would exist</p> <pre><code>public interface IFoo { string Test(); }\n</code></pre> <p>(We\u2019ve illustrated this by showing a C# interface\u2014not a COM interface. The princi\u2010 ple, however, is the same\u2014although the plumbing is different.)</p> <p>When it comes to adding the overloaded version of Test, life is more complicated with COM than with .NET. First, we would avoid modifying the IFoo interface because this would break binary compatibility with the previous version (one of the principles of COM is that interfaces, once published, are immutable). Second, COM doesn\u2019t allow method overloading. The solution is to instead have Foo implement a second interface:</p> <pre><code>public interface IFoo2 { string Test (string s); }\n//(Again, we\u2019ve transliterated this into a .NET interface for familiarity.)\n</code></pre> <p>Supporting multiple interfaces is of key importance in making COM libraries versionable</p>"},{"location":"Code/C%23%208%20%20in%20Nutshell%20Summary.html#iunknown-and-idispatch","title":"IUnknown and IDispatch","text":"<p>All COM interfaces are identified with a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).</p> <p>The root interface in COM is IUnknown all COM objects must implement it. This interface has three methods:</p> <ul> <li>AddRef</li> <li>Release</li> <li>QueryInterface</li> </ul> <p>AddRef and Release are for lifetime management given that COM uses reference counting rather than automatic garbage collection (COM was designed to work with unmanaged code, where automatic garbage collection isn\u2019t feasible). The Query Interface method returns an object reference that supports that interface, if it can do so.</p> <p>To enable dynamic programming (e.g., scripting and automation), a COM object can also implement IDispatch.

These include resizable lists, linked lists, sorted and unsorted dictionaries, as well as arrays. Of these, only arrays form part of the C# language; the remaining collections are just classes you instantiate like any other\n\nWe can divide the types in the Framework for collections into the following categories\n\n- Interfaces that define standard collection protocols\n- Ready-to-use collection classes (lists, dictionaries, etc.)\n- Base classes for writing application-specific collections\n\nThe collection namespaces are as follows\n\n- `System.Collections` Nongeneric collection classes and interfaces\n- `System.Collections.Specialized` Strongly typed nongeneric collection classes\n- `System.Collections.Generic` Generic collection classes and interfaces\n- `System.Collections.ObjectModel` Proxies and bases for custom collections\n- `System.Collections.Concurrent` Thread-safe collections (see Chapter 23)\n\n# Enumeration\n\nIn computing, there are many different kinds of collections, ranging from simple data structures such as arrays or linked lists, to more complex ones such as red/black trees and hashtables. Although the internal implementation and external\n\ncharacteristics of these data structures vary widely, the ability to traverse the contents of the collection is an almost universal need. The Framework supports this need via a pair of interfaces (IEnumerable, IEnumerator, and their generic counterparts) that allow different data structures to expose a common traversal API.\n\nThe IEnumerator interface defines the basic low-level protocol by which elements in a collection are traversed\u2014or enumerated\u2014in a forward-only manner. \n\n```csharp\npublic interface IEnumerator\n{\n bool MoveNext();\n object Current { get; }\n void Reset();\n}\n</code></pre> <p>MoveNext advances the current element or \u201ccursor\u201d to the next position, returning false if there are no more elements in the collection. Current returns the element at the current position (usually cast from object to a more specific type). MoveNext must be called before retrieving the first element\u2014this is to allow for an empty collection. The Reset method, if implemented, moves back to the start, allowing the collection to be enumerated again. Reset exists mainly for Component Object Model (COM) interoperability; calling it directly is generally avoided because it\u2019s not universally supported (and is unnecessary in that it\u2019s usually just as easy to instantiate a new enumerator.)</p> <p>Collections do not usually implement enumerators; instead, they provide enumera\u2010 tors, via the interface IEnumerable</p> <pre><code>public interface IEnumerable\n{\n IEnumerator GetEnumerator();\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>string s = \"Hello\";\n\n// Because string implements IEnumerable, we can call GetEnumerator():\nIEnumerator rator = s.GetEnumerator();\n\nwhile (rator.MoveNext())\n{\n    char c = (char) rator.Current;\n    Console.Write (c + \".\");\n}\n\nConsole.WriteLine();\n\n// Equivalent to:\n\nforeach (char c in s)\n    Console.Write (c + \".\");\n</code></pre>","text":""},{"location":"Code/C%23%208%20%20in%20Nutshell%20Summary.html#ienumerable-and-ienumerator","title":"IEnumerable and IEnumerator <p>IEnumerator and IEnumerable are nearly always implemented in conjunction with their extended generic versions</p> <pre><code>public interface IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; : IEnumerator, IDisposable\n{\n T Current { get; }\n}\npublic interface IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; : IEnumerable\n{\n IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator();\n}\n</code></pre> <p>By defining a typed version of Current and GetEnumerator, these interfaces strengthen static type safety, avoid the overhead of boxing with value-type elements, and are more convenient to the consumer.

The more precisely you can specify the shape of the data your code accepts and returns, the more the compiler can help you avoid mistakes.</p> <p>That\u2019s particularly true as the application you\u2019re building grows. If you can see all the code for your whole program on one screen (or at least hold it all in your head at one time), a statically typed language doesn\u2019t have much benefit. As the scale increases, it becomes increasingly important that your code concisely and effectively communicates what it does. You can do that through documentation, but static typing lets you communicate in a machine-readable way.</p> <p>As C# has evolved, its type system has allowed more fine-grained descriptions. The most obvious example of this is generics. In C# 1, you might have had code like this:</p> <p><pre><code>public class Bookshelf\n{\n public IEnumerable Books { get { ... } }\n}\n</code></pre> What type is each item in the Books sequence? The type system doesn\u2019t tell you. With generics in C# 2, you can communicate more effectively:</p> <p><pre><code>public class Bookshelf\n{\n public IEnumerable&lt;Book&gt; Books { get { ... } }\n}\n</code></pre> C# 2 also brought nullable value types, thereby allowing the absence of information to be expressed effectively without resorting to magic values such as \u20131 for a collection index or DateTime.MinValue for a date.</p> <p>The plans for C# 8 include nullable reference types, which will allow even more communication. Up to this point, nothing in the language lets you express whether a reference (either as a return value, a parameter, or just a local variable) might be null. This leads to error-prone code if you\u2019re not careful and boilerplate validation code if you are careful, neither of which is ideal. C# 8 will expect that anything not explicitly nullable is intended not to be nullable. For example, consider a method declaration like this:</p> <pre><code>string Method(string x, string? y)\n</code></pre> <p>The parameter types indicate that the argument corresponding to x shouldn\u2019t be null but that the argument corresponding to y may be null.

This tension can cause problems at the boundaries of our systems.</p> <p>Let's look at java.util.Map as an example. Maps have a very broad interface with plenty of capabilities. Certainly this power and flexibility is useful, but it can also be a liability. For instance, our application might build up a Map and pass it around. Our intention might be that none of the recipients of our Map delete anything in the map. But right there at the top of the list is the clear() method. Any user of the Map has the power to clear it.

The client of this code carries the responsibility of getting an Object from the Map and casting it to the right type. This works, but it's not clean code. Also, this code does not tell its story as well as it could.</p> <p>A cleaner way to use Map might look like the following. No user of Sensors would care one bit if generics were used or not.

Their variables did not have to be well named, their test functions did not need to be short and descriptive. Their test code did not need to be well designed and thoughtfully partitioned. So long as the test code worked, and so long as it covered the production code, it was good enough.</p> <p>What this team did not realize was that having dirty tests is equivalent to, if not worse than, having no tests. The problem is that tests must change as the production code evolves. The dirtier the tests, the harder they are to change. The more tangled the test code, the more likely it is that you will spend more time cramming new tests into the suite than it takes to write the new production code. As you modify the production code, old tests start to fail, and the mess in the test code makes it hard to get those tests to pass again. So the tests become viewed as an ever-increasing liability.</p> <p>From release to release the cost of maintaining my team's test suite rose. Eventually it became the single biggest complaint among the developers. When managers asked why their estimates were getting so large, the developers blamed the tests. In the end they were forced to discard the test suite entirely.</p> <p>But, without a test suite they lost the ability to make sure that changes to their code base worked as expected. Without a test suite they could not ensure that changes to one part of their system did not break other parts of their system. So their defect rate began to rise. As the number of unintended defects rose, they started to fear making changes. They stopped cleaning their production code because they feared the changes would do more harm than good.

Transactions are incredibly important as soon as you work with databases. And a drawing is a database.</p> <p>In that drawing database are tables with layer names, tables with text styles, tables with block definitions and tables with Entities. To communicate with that database you need a Transaction. It can fetch objects from the database for you if you only have an ObjectId and can put objects into the database that you have created yourself. Or modified.</p> <p>transaction.Commit() is an important function of the Transaction. It actually applies all changes and additions to the drawing database. As long as no Commit() is executed, the drawing database remains unchanged.</p> <p>this is beneficial because otherwise it could corrupt the drawing. Suppose your function changes all kinds of things in the database and halfway through the function it stops working because of an error. The database is then filled with incorrect objects. A reference to a layer name that does not yet exist in the drawing for example.</p> <p>Therefore all changes within the Transaction happen somewhere in memory and are only finally applied to the drawing database with the function Commit(). If you forget to call this function then nothing has happened in the drawing.</p>"},{"location":"Code/Start%20Programming%20in%20NET%20for%20AutoCAD.html#object-ids-and-handles","title":"Object Ids and Handles","text":"<p>ObjectIds are references to database objects. Every object in the drawing database has an ObjectId as identification. If you have ever called up a LIST of an object in AutoCAD, then you have probably seen the term Handle pass by. Every Entity in AutoCAD has a Handle. This is a hexadecimal number like 14F or 3A7. But a drawing database contains more than just objects with Handles. A layer name does not have a Handle. Therefore, although every object in the database contains an ObjectId, not every object contains a Handle. An ObjectId is a very large number like 2152212828304.</p> <p>When opening a drawing, AutoCAD will assign an ObjectId to each object in the database. This is not always the same number. Handles, however, always remain the same. If you open the same drawing tomorrow as you did today and there is a Line in it, then tomorrow that Line will have the same Handle as today, but not the same ObjectId.</p> <p>As long as the drawing is open, this of course remains the same. And that's why you can refer to an ObjectId in your code just fine if you need a specific object. Many functions like GetEntity() will return the ObjectId of the Entity. You then use this ObjectId in your code to refer to that specific object.</p> <p>In this case, the code always goes well because you only pass ObjectIds that are of the type Entity. But if you pass an ObjectId of a Layer or of a text style? Those can't just be converted to an Entity. AutoCAD will then show a Fatal Error as soon as you try to convert the ObjectId to an Entity object.</p> <p>Another error that can occur is when you query an object that has been deleted. For example, if you delete a Layer in AutoCAD, it secretly continues to exist but gets a check mark in the drawing database for the IsErased property</p> <p>This has two useful consequences: an UNDO is easily realized with this and the speed of work is not hindered. Only when saving the drawing are all objects to be deleted actually removed from the database.</p> <p>If this were done immediately then each operation would take as long as saving and reopening the drawing. Large drawings take as much as tens of seconds to open.</p> <p>You can avoid this kind of error by checking if an ObjectId is of a certain type, if the object has been deleted or by error interception.</p>"},{"location":"Code/Start%20Programming%20in%20NET%20for%20AutoCAD.html#layer-creation-function","title":"Layer creation function","text":"<pre><code>using Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices;\nusing Autodesk.AutoCAD.Geometry;\npublic static void CreateLayer(string name)\n{\nDatabase db = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.Database;\nusing (Transaction tr = db.TransactionManager.

It's a complex function with a lot of new stuff. Of course, you start again with a using for the Transaction. Then you start by creating an object of the type LayerTable. By now you know that the drawing is a database. The database contains several tables. For block definitions you have a table, for line type styles you have a table and for layer names you have a table, for everything you have a table. The table for layer names is of the type LayerTable (nice and simple) and you can cast such an object from the ObjectId that the database keeps for this table. You can see that in the line as a parameter of the function GetObject() where you refer to db.LayerTableId.</p> <p>This object you have named lt. As you can see, this book uses simple object names. Usually an abbreviation or initial of the object type. You may name these as you like, as long as you remember what you used and the name is not a reserved word. So you may also use the following</p> <pre><code>LayerTable layertableobject = (LayerTable)tr.GetObject(db.LayerTableId, OpenMode.ForRead);\n</code></pre> <p>The next line checks whether the layer name already exists. The object lt of the object type LayerTable has a nice function called Has(). This means something like \"Does the LayerTable have the following layer name, yes or no\". This function returns true or false.</p> <p>Now you should be aware that AutoCAD does not immediately delete objects when you discard them from the drawing but marks them in the database as IsErased. Only when saving to the database will these objects disappear into the big void. But as long as a drawing is open, you create a layer and then delete it, this Property will return true if you want to know if the layer is present. Because you will also get back layers that are marked as deleted, that's why you need to do an extra check just to be sure.</p> <p>The code to create the layer is complex. First, you call the UpgradeOpen() function on the LayerTable. This is necessary because the LayerTable is opened as ReadOnly. You can also skip this line but then you should have created the object lt with the OpenMode.ForWrite parameter. It doesn't matter whether you use one or the other method, probably only speed will be an issue.</p> <p>Next you create a LayerTableRecord object with the name ltr. A LayerTable contains LayerTableRecords, one for each layer. You give this LayerTableRecord the desired name (and possibly color, line type, transparency and other layer options) and then you add it to the LayerTable.</p> <p>You also add it to the Transaction with the line:</p> <pre><code>tr.AddNewlyCreatedDBObject(ltr, true);\n</code></pre> <p>This seems duplicative. But this way the Transaction knows which objects have been added to the database. Earlier I explained that changes to the database are not applied until you call the Commit() function. If you forget this line, nothing happens in the drawing at all.</p>"},{"location":"Code/Start%20Programming%20in%20NET%20for%20AutoCAD.html#save-data-in-drawing","title":"Save data in drawing","text":"<p>Overview</p> <p>There are several ways to store data. One of the oldest data facilities is called XData. You can store up to 16K of data on objects. The data can be easily read by Lisp, making it quite powerful. AutoCAD internal functions also sometimes store data as XData, such as hyperlinks. With the XDLIST command, you can query which data has been stored:</p> <pre><code>*Registered Application Name: PE_URL\n* Code 1000, ASCII string: https://blog.huiz.net\n* Code 1002, Starting or ending brace: {\n* Code 1000, ASCII string: Blog\n* Code 1002, Starting or ending brace: {\n* Code 1071, 32-bit signed long integer: 1\n* Code 1002, Starting or ending brace: }\n* Code 1002, Starting or ending brace: }\nObject has 16311 bytes of Xdata space available\n</code></pre> <p>Because 16K of data is very little (or at least not always enough), another technique has been devised, namely XRecords. With this technique you can link unlimited amounts of data to objects.</p> <p>If you have AutoCAD Map 3D or Civil 3D you can also store data as Object Data or Property Sets, but these are not recognizable in AutoCAD.

Add these two functions to the same class:</p> <pre><code>                /// &lt;summary&gt;\n        /// Save a textstring in the ExtensionDictionary of an object\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n        public static void SetObjXRecordText(ObjectId id, string key, string value)\n        {\n            using (ResultBuffer resBuf = new ResultBuffer(new TypedValue((int)DxfCode.Text, value)))\n            {\n                SetXRecordInObject(id, key, resBuf);\n            }\n        }\n\n        /// &lt;summary&gt;\n        /// Save an integer in the ExtensionDictionary of an object\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n        public static void SetObjXRecordInt32(ObjectId id, string key, int value)\n        {\n            using (ResultBuffer resBuf = new ResultBuffer(new TypedValue((int)DxfCode.Int32, value)))\n            {\n                SetXRecordInObject(id, key, resBuf);\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre> <p>You can see that both functions call the private function SetXRecordInObject(). So it saves a lot of typing if you had wanted to include the code from that function in both of these functions. Here you see how easy it is to pull equal code separately into an additional function that is then shared.</p> <p>The same goes for the code to retrieve data. Again, you need functions that retrieve text or numbers from an object. Add these functions as well:</p> <pre><code>                /// &lt;summary&gt;\n        /// Read a string from the ExtensionDictionary of an object\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n        public static string GetObjXRecordText(ObjectId id, string key)\n        {\n            string returnValue = string.Empty;\n            List&lt;object&gt; records = GetXRecordFromObject(id, key);\n            if (records.Count &gt; 0) { returnValue = Convert.ToString(records[records.Count - 1]); }\n            return returnValue;\n        }\n\n        /// &lt;summary&gt;\n        /// Read an integer from the ExtensionDictionary of an object\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n        public static int GetObjXRecordInt32(ObjectId id, string key)\n        {\n            int returnValue = -1;\n            List&lt;object&gt; records = GetXRecordFromObject(id, key);\n            if (records.Count &gt; 0) { returnValue = Convert.ToInt32(records[records.Count - 1]); }\n            return returnValue;\n        }\n</code></pre> <p>Because the generic function GetXRecordFromObject() can return a list of values, more than one, because more were added or because the previous one was removed and added again, the last value from the list is returned as the value we want. This is done with the code: records[records. Countt - 1];</p> <p>The index value of the record you want to retrieve is normally placed between square brackets. To retrieve the last one, use the Count minus 1 property. Since lists are zero-based indexed, a list of ten records will consist of record[0], record[1], through record[9]. Because the Count property returns the value 10, you therefore call the last record with Count-1.</p>"},{"location":"Code/Test-Driven%20Development%20By%20Example.html","title":"Test-Driven Development By Example by Kent Beck","text":""},{"location":"Code/Test-Driven%20Development%20By%20Example.html#preface","title":"Preface","text":""},{"location":"Code/Test-Driven%20Development%20By%20Example.html#redgreenrefactorthe-tdd-mantra","title":"Red/green/refactor\u2014the TDD mantra","text":"<ul> <li>Red<ul> <li>Write a little test that doesn't work, and perhaps doesn't even compile at first.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Green<ul> <li>Make the test work quickly, committing whatever sins necessary in the process.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Refactor<ul> <li>Eliminate all of the duplication created in merely getting the test to work.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Code/Test-Driven%20Development%20By%20Example.html#redgreenrefactorthe-tdd-mantra_1","title":"Red/green/refactor\u2014the TDD mantra","text":"<p>Assuming for the moment that such a programming style is possible, it further might be possible to dramatically reduce the defect density of code and make the subject of work crystal clear to all involved.

TDD is no different. If you're happy slamming some code together that more or less works and you're happy never looking at the result again, TDD is not for you. TDD rests on a charmingly na\u00efve geekoid assumption that if you write better code, you'll be more successful. TDD helps you to pay attention to the right issues at the right time so you can make your designs cleaner, you can refine your designs as you learn.</p> <p>I say \"na\u00efve,\" but that's perhaps overstating. What's na\u00efve is assuming that clean code is all there is to success. Good engineering is maybe 20 percent of a project's success. Bad engineering will certainly sink projects, but modest engineering can enable project success as long as the other 80 percent lines up right. From this perspective, TDD is overkill. It lets you write code with far fewer defects and a much cleaner design than is common in the industry. However, those whose souls are healed by the balm of elegance can find in TDD a way to do well by doing good.</p> <p>TDD is also good for geeks who form emotional attachments to code. One of the great frustrations of my young engineer's life was starting a project with great excitement, then watching the code base decay over time. A year later I wanted nothing more than to dump the now-smelly code and get on to the next project. TDD enables you to gain confidence in the code over time. As tests accumulate (and your testing improves), you gain confidence in the behavior of the system. As you refine the design, more and more changes become possible. My goal is to feel better about a project after a year than I did in the starry-eyed beginning, and TDD helps me achieve this.</p>"},{"location":"Code/Test-Driven%20Development%20By%20Example.html#why-does-tdd-work","title":"Why does TDD work?","text":"<p>Prepare to leave the galaxy. Let's assume for the moment that TDD helps teams productively build loosely coupled, highly cohesive systems with low defect rates and low cost maintenance profiles. (I'm claiming no such thing in general, but I trust you to imagine impossible things.) How could such a thing happen?</p> <p>Part of the effect certainly comes from reducing defects. The sooner you find and fix a defect, the cheaper it is, often dramatically so (just ask the Mars Lander). There are plenty of secondary psychological and social effects from reduced defects. My own practice of programming became much less stressful when I started with TDD. No longer did I have to worry about everything at once. I could make this test run, and then all the rest. Relationships with my teammates became more positive. I stopped breaking builds, and people could rely on my software to work. Customers of my systems became more positive, too. A new release of the system just meant more functionality, not a host of new defects to identify among all of their old favorite bugs.</p> <p>Reduced defects. Where do I get off claiming such a thing? Do I have scientific proof?</p> <p>No. No studies have categorically demonstrated the difference between TDD and any of the many alternatives in quality, productivity, or fun. However, the anecdotal evidence is overwhelming, and the secondary effects are unmistakable. Programmers really do relax, teams really do develop trust, and customers really do learn to look forward to new releases. \"By and large,\" I will say, although I haven't seen the opposite effect. Your mileage may vary, but you'll have to try it to find out.</p> <p>Another advantage of TDD that may explain its effect is the way it shortens the feedback loop on design decisions. The feedback loop for implementation decisions is obviously short \u2014seconds or minutes, followed by rerunning the tests tens or hundreds of times a day. The loop for design decisions goes between the design thought\u2014perhaps the API should like this, or perhaps the metaphor should be that\u2014and the first example, a test that embodies that thought. Rather than designing and then waiting weeks or months for someone else to feel the pain or glory, feedback comes in seconds or minutes as you try to translate your ideas into a plausible interface.</p> <p>A weirder answer to, \"Why does TDD work?\" comes from the fevered imagination of complex systems. The inimitable Phlip says:</p> <p>Adopt programming practices that \"attract\" correct code as a limit function, not as an absolute value. If you write unit tests for every feature, and if you refactor to simplify code between each step, and if you add features one at a time and only after all the unit tests pass, you will create what mathematicians call an \"attractor.\" This is a point in a state space that all flows converge on. Code is more likely to change for the better over time instead of for the worse; the attractor approaches correctness as a limit function. This is the \"correctness\" that nearly all programmers get by with (except, of course, for medical or aerospace software). But it's better to explicitly understand the attractor concept than deny it or disregard its importance.</p>"},{"location":"Code/The%20Art%20of%20Unit%20Testing%20With%20Examples%20in%20NET.html","title":"The Art of Unit Testing: With Examples in .NET by Roy Osherove","text":""},{"location":"Code/The%20Art%20of%20Unit%20Testing%20With%20Examples%20in%20NET.html#chapter-0-title","title":"Chapter 0 : Title","text":""},{"location":"Code/The%20Art%20of%20Unit%20Testing%20With%20Examples%20in%20NET.html#chapter-1-the-basics-of-unit-testing","title":"Chapter 1 : The basics of unit testing","text":""},{"location":"Code/The%20Art%20of%20Unit%20Testing%20With%20Examples%20in%20NET.html#defining-unit-testing-step-by-step","title":"Defining unit testing, step by step","text":"\ud83d\udce2 **DEFINITION 1.0** A unit test is a piece of a code (usually a method) that invokes another piece of code and checks the correctness of some assumptions afterward.

If you knew you weren\u2019t breaking anything, you\u2019d be much less afraid of taking on code you\u2019re less familiar with, because you have that safety net of unit tests.</li> <li>Good tests can be accessed and run by anyone.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Can I run all the tests I\u2019ve written in no more than a few minutes?<ul> <li>If you can\u2019t run your tests quickly (seconds are better than minutes), you\u2019ll run them less often (daily or even weekly or monthly in some places). The problem is that when you change code, you want to get feedback as early as possible to see if you broke something. The more time between running the tests, the more changes you make to the system, and the (many) more places to search for bugs when you find that you broke something.</li> <li>Good tests should run quickly</li> </ul> </li> <li>Can I run all the tests I\u2019ve written at the push of a button?<ul> <li>If you can\u2019t, it probably means that you have to configure the machine on which the tests will run so that they run correctly (setting connection strings to the database, for example) or that your unit tests aren\u2019t fully automated. If you can\u2019t fully automate your unit tests, you\u2019ll probably avoid running them repeatedly, as will everyone else on your team.</li> <li>Good tests should be easily executed in their original form, not manually.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Can I write a basic test in no more than a few minutes?<ul> <li>The harder it is to write a test, the less likely you are to write more tests or to focus on anything other than the \u201cbig stuff\u201d that you\u2019re worried about. One of the strengths of unit tests is that they tend to test every little thing that might break, not only the big stuff. People are often surprised at how many bugs they can find in code they thought was simple and bug free.</li> <li>Good tests against the system should be easy and quick to write, once you\u2019ve figured out the patterns you want to use to test your specific object model. Small warning: even experienced unit testers can find that it may take 30 minutes or more to figure out how to write the very first unit test against an object model they\u2019ve never unit tested before. This is part of the work, and is expected. The second and subsequent tests on that object model should be very easy to accomplish.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Code/The%20Art%20of%20Unit%20Testing%20With%20Examples%20in%20NET.html#what-makes-unit-tests-good","title":"What makes unit tests good","text":"\ud83d\udce2 **DEFINITION 1.2** A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes the unit of work being tested, and then checks some assumptions about a single end result of that unit.

That way, you only pass around one object with all the relevant dependencies</p> <p>Another possible solution is using inversion of control (IoC) containers. You can think of IoC containers as \u201csmart factories\u201d for your objects (although they\u2019re much more than that). A few well-known containers of this type are Microsoft Unity, StructureMap, and Castle Windsor. They provide special factory methods that take in the type of object you\u2019d like to create and any dependencies that it needs and then initialize the object using special configurable rules such as what constructor to call, what properties to set in what order, and so on. They\u2019re powerful when put to use on a complicated composite object hierarchy where creating an object requires creating and initializing objects several levels down the line. If your class needs an ILogger interface at its constructor, for example, you can configure such a container object to always return the same ILogger object that you give it, when resolving this interface requirement. The end result of using containers is usually simpler handling and retrieving of objects and less worry about the dependencies or maintaining the constructors.</p>  \ud83d\udd25 TIP There are many other successful container implementations, such as Autofac or Ninject, so look at them when you read more about this topic. Dealing with containers is beyond the scope of this book, but you can start reading about them with Scott Hanselman\u2019s list at www.hanselman.com/ blog/ListOfNETDependencyInjectionContainersIOC.aspx.

Throughout reported time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world. The high, the middle, and the low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age. But the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other. The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the high is to remain where they are. The aim of the middle is to change places with the high. The aim of the low, when they have an aim, for it is an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives, is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal.  Thus, throughout history, a struggle, which is the same in its main outlines, recurs over and over again. For long periods, the high seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later, there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the middle, who enlist the low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude and themselves become the high. Presently, a new middle group splits off from one of the other groups or from both of them and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer. From the point of view of the low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters. </p>"},{"location":"Fantasy/AnimalFarm.html","title":"Animal Farm by George Orwell","text":""},{"location":"Fantasy/AnimalFarm.html#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<ul> <li>Animal Farm is the story of a set of animals who overthrow their human-owner.</li> <li>This book will explain Communism in the form of simple stories from the perspective of animals</li> <li>Lot of political maneuvers and totalitarian rule is explained using animals perspectives similar to what humans do</li> <li>Book will start with animimal rebellion to start revolution to stop what is happening and comming to same position from it's started. going full circle.

Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival.

How can anyone spend their whole life longing for the day when they become superfluous? Wandering about, a burden on society, what sort of man would ever wish for that? Staying at home, waiting to die. Or even worse: waiting for them to come and fetch you and put you in a home. Being dependent on other people to get to the toilet. Ove can\u2019t think of anything worse. His wife often teases him, says he\u2019s the only man she knows who\u2019d rather be laid out in a coffin than travel in a mobility service van.\u201d  \u2015 Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove</p> <p>\u201cEvery human being needs to know what she's fighting for.

Maybe mostly because they were understandable. They could be calculated and drawn on paper. They did not leak if they were made water tight, they did not collapse if they were properly supported. Houses were fair, they gave you what you deserved. Which, unfortunately, was more than one could say about people.\u201d  \u2015 Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove</p> <p>\u201cThat was why he had always liked mathematics. There were right or wrong answers there. Not like the other hippie subjects they tried to trick you into doing at school, where you could \u201cargue your case.\u201d As if that was a way of concluding a discussion: checking who knew more long words.

Something the people around her also kept telling Sonja. He\u2019d been a grumpy old man since he started elementary school, they insisted. And she could have someone so much better. Maybe he didn\u2019t write her poems or serenade her with songs or come home with expensive gifts. But he believed so strongly in things: justice and fair play and hard work and a world where right just had to be right. Not so one could get a medal or a diploma or a slap on the back for it, but just because that was how it was supposed to be. Not many men of his kind were made anymore, Sonja had understood. So she was holding on to this one.\u201d  \u2015 Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove</p> <p>\u201cHe sits there for what must be an hour, just staring at that photo. Of all the imaginable things he most misses about her, the thing he really wishes he could do again is hold her hand in his. She had a way of folding her index finger into his palm, hiding it inside. And he always felt that nothing in the world was impossible when she did that. Of all the things he could miss, that's what he misses most.\u201d  \u2015 Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove</p> <p>\u201cPeople had always said that Ove was bitter. But he wasn't bloody bitter. He just didn't go around grinning the whole time. Did that mean one had to be treated like a criminal? Ove hardly thought so. Something inside a man goes to pieces when he has to bury the only person who ever understood him.\u201d  \u2015 Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s the sort of man who gives up and dies; he doesn\u2019t want her to think that. But it\u2019s actually wrong, all this. She married him. And now he doesn\u2019t quite know how to carry on without the tip of her nose in the pit between his throat and his shoulder. That\u2019s all.\u201d  \u2015 Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove</p> <p>\u201cOve is the sort of man who checks the status of all things by giving them a good kick.\u201d  \u2015 Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove</p>"},{"location":"Fiction/A%20Thousand%20Splendid%20Suns.html","title":"A Thousands Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini","text":"<p>A Thousand Splendid Suns\u201cMarriage can wait, education cannot.\u201d\u2015 Khaled Hosseini, A Thousand Splendid Suns</p> <p>\u201cOne could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.\u201d\u2015 Khaled Hosseini, A Thousand Splendid Suns</p> <p>\u201cA society has no chance of success if its women are uneducated...\u201d\u2015 Khaled Hosseini, A Thousand Splendid Suns</p> <p>\u201cA man's heart is a wretched, wretched thing.

You do not tear from place to place and unsettle yourself with one move after another. Restlessness of that sort is symptomatic of a sick mind. Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man\u2019s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.</p> <p>To be everywhere is to be nowhere. People who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but no real friendships. The same must needs be the case with people who never set about acquiring an intimate acquaintanceship with any one great writer, but skip from one to another, paying flying visits to them all. Food that is vomited up as soon as it is eaten is not assimilated into the body and does not do one any good; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent changes of treatment; a wound will not heal over if it is being made the subject of experiments with different ointments; a plant which is frequently moved never grows strong. Nothing is so useful that it can be of any service in the mere passing. A multitude of books only gets in one\u2019s way. So if you are unable to read all the books in your possession, you have enough when you have all the books you are able to read. And if you say, \u2018But I feel like opening different books at different times\u2019, my answer will be this: tasting one dish after another is the sign of a fussy stomach, and where the foods are dissimilar and diverse in range they lead to contamination of the system, not nutrition. So always read well-tried authors, and if at any moment you find yourself wanting a change from a particular author, go back to ones you have read before</p> <p>\u2018A cheerful poverty,\u2019 he says, \u2018is an honourable state.\u2019 But if it is cheerful it is not poverty at all. It is not the man who has too little who is poor, but the one who hankers after more. What difference does it make how much there is laid away in a man\u2019s safe or in his barns, how many head of stock he grazes or how much capital he puts out at interest, if he is always after what is another\u2019s and only counts what he has yet to get, never what he has already. You ask what is the proper limit to a person\u2019s wealth?

What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life\u2014daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.</p> <p>I said that even in this Europe in the sixth winter of the Second World War, our situation was not the most terrible we could think of. I said that each of us had to ask himself what irreplaceable losses he had suffered up to then. I speculated that for most of them these losses had really been few. Whoever was still alive had reason for hope. Health, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society \u2014all these were things that could be achieved again or restored. After all, we still had all our bones intact. Whatever we had gone through could still be an asset to us in the future.

We act like normal colleagues who don\u2019t want to swirl their hands in each other\u2019s blood. It\u2019s disturbing. \u201cGreat, thanks, Big Josh. How You Doing?\u201d \u201cSuper. Gonna go get coffee. Can I get you some tea?\u201d He has his heavy black mug in his hand. I hate his mug. I look down; my hand is already holding my red polka-dot mug. He\u2019d spit in anything he made me. Does he think I\u2019m crazy? \u201cI think I\u2019ll join you.\u201d We march purposefully toward the kitchen with identical footfalls, left, right, left, right, like prosecutors walking toward the camera in the opening credits of Law &amp; Order. It requires me to almost double my stride. Colleagues break off conversations and look at us with speculative expressions. Joshua and I look at each other and bare our teeth. Time to act civil. Like executives. \u201cAh-ha-ha,\u201d we say to each other genially at some pretend joke. \u201cAh-ha-ha.\u201d We sweep around a corner. Annabelle turns from the photocopier and almost drops her papers. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Joshua and I nod at her and continue striding, unified in our endless game of one-upmanship. My short striped dress flaps from the g-force. \u201cMommy and Daddy love you very much, kids,\u201d Joshua says quietly so only I can hear him. To the casual onlooker he is politely chatting. A few meerkat heads have popped up over cubicle walls. It seems we\u2019re the stuff of legend. \u201cSometimes we get excited and argue. But don\u2019t be scared. Even when we\u2019re arguing, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just grown-up stuff,\u201d I softly explain to the apprehensive faces we pass. \u201cSometimes Daddy sleeps on the couch, but it\u2019s okay.

I\u2019m equally insane.\u201d \u201cYou cracked the shirt code pretty quick.\u201d \u201cWhy do you even wear them in sequence?\u201d \u201cI wanted to see if you noticed. And once you did notice, it pissed you off.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always noticed.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He smiles, and I smile too. \u201d \u2015 Sally Thorne, The Hating Game</p> <p>\u201cI pull back. \"I'm going to have to change my computer password.\" \"Oh yeah? To what?\" \"I-love-Josh.\" \"4 eva, he replies.\" \"You cracked my password?\u201d \u2015 Sally Thorne, The Hating Game</p> <p>\u201cThe Kissing Game goes like this, Shortcake. Press, retreat, tilt, breathe, repeat. Use your hands to angle just right. Loosen up until it\u2019s a slow, wet slide. Hear the drum of blood in your own ears? Survive on tiny puffs of air. Do not stop. Don\u2019t even think about it. Shudder a sigh, pull back, let your opponent catch you with lips or teeth and ease you back into something even deeper. Wetter. Feel your nerve endings crackle to life with each touch of tongue. Feel a new heaviness between your legs. The aim of the game is to do this for the rest of your life. Screw human civilization and all it entails. This elevator is home now. This is what we do now. Do not fucking stop.

Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned, starved, stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or otherwise deflected from its life's quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material to the right partner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that could result -- eventually, astoundingly, and all too briefly -- in you.</p> <p>There are three stages in scientific discovery. First, people deny that it is true, then they deny that it is important; finally they credit the wrong person.</p> <p>Bill Bryson, A Short History of Nearly Everything</p> <p>\u201cIt is easy to overlook this thought that life just is. As humans we are inclined to feel that life must have a point. We have plans and aspirations and desires. We want to take constant advantage of all the intoxicating existence we've been endowed with.

If I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don't.

Not until almost 8:30 in the evening, with the day five-sixths over, has Earth anything to show the universe but a restless skin of microbes. Then, finally, the first sea plants appear, followed twenty minutes later by the first jellyfish and the enigmatic Ediacaran fauna first seen by Reginald Sprigg in Australia. At 9:04 P.M. trilobites swim onto the scene, followed more or less immediately by the shapely creatures of the Burgess Shale. Just before 10 P.M. plants begin to pop up on the land. Soon after, with less than two hours left in the day, the first land creatures follow.</p> <p>Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are evident. Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before 11 P.M. and hold sway for about three-quarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins. Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight. The whole of our recorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime barely an instant. Throughout this greatly speeded-up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positively reckless. Mountains rise and melt away, ocean basins come and go, ice sheets advance and withdraw. And throughout the whole, about three times every minute, somewhere on the planet there is a flash-bulb pop of light marking the impact of a Manson-sized meteor or one even larger. It's a wonder that anything at all can survive in such a pummeled and unsettled environment.

Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. As creatures of habit, people have a hard time adjusting to changes in sleep patterns. Sleeping later on weekends won\u2019t fully make up for a lack of sleep during the week and will make it harder to wake up early on Monday morning. Set an alarm for bedtime. Often we set an alarm for when it\u2019s time to wake up but fail to do so for when it\u2019s time to go to sleep. If there is only one piece of advice you remember and take from these twelve tips, this should be it.</li> <li>Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. Try to exercise at least thirty minutes on most days but not later than two to three hours before your bedtime.</li> <li>Avoid caffeine and nicotine. Coffee, colas, certain teas, and chocolate contain the stimulant caffeine, and its effects can take as long as eight hours to wear off fully. Therefore, a cup of coffee in the late afternoon can make it hard for you to fall asleep at night.</li> <li>Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. Having a nightcap or alcoholic beverage before sleep may help you relax, but heavy use robs you of REM sleep, keeping you in the lighter stages of sleep.</li> <li>Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. A light snack is okay, but a large meal can cause indigestion, which interferes with sleep. Drinking too many fluids at night can cause frequent awakenings to urinate.</li> <li>Don\u2019t take naps after 3 p.m. Naps can help make up for lost sleep, but late afternoon naps can make it harder to fall asleep at night.</li> <li>Relax before bed. Don\u2019t overschedule your day so that no time is left for unwinding. A relaxing activity, such as reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.</li> <li>Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom. Get rid of anything in your bedroom that might distract you from sleep, such as noises, bright lights, an uncomfortable bed, or warm temperatures. You sleep better if the temperature in the room is kept on the cool side. A TV, cell phone, or computer in the bedroom can be a distraction and deprive you of needed sleep. Having a comfortable mattress and pillow can help promote a good night\u2019s sleep. Individuals who have insomnia often watch the clock.

For some people, their peak of wakefulness arrives early in the day, and their sleepiness trough arrives early at night. These are \u201cmorning types,\u201d and make up about 40 percent of the populace. They prefer to wake at or around dawn, are happy to do so, and function optimally at this time of day. Others are \u201cevening types,\u201d and account for approximately 30 percent of the population. They naturally prefer going to bed late and subsequently wake up late the following morning, or even in the afternoon. The remaining 30 percent of people lie somewhere in between morning and evening types, with a slight leaning toward eveningness, like myself.</p> <p>You may colloquially know these two types of people as \u201cmorning larks\u201d and \u201cnight owls,\u201d respectively. Unlike morning larks, night owls are frequently incapable of falling asleep early at night, no matter how hard they try. It is only in the early-morning hours that owls can drift off. Having not fallen asleep until late, owls of course strongly dislike waking up early. They are unable to function well at this time, one cause of which is that, despite being \u201cawake,\u201d their brain remains in a more sleep-like state throughout the early morning. This is especially true of a region called the prefrontal cortex, which sits above the eyes, and can be thought of as the head office of the brain. The prefrontal cortex controls high-level thought and logical reasoning, and helps keep our emotions in check. When a night owl is forced to wake up too early, their prefrontal cortex remains in a disabled, \u201coffline\u201d state. Like a cold engine after an early-morning start, it takes a long time before it warms up to operating temperature, and before that will not function efficiently.</p> <p>adult\u2019s owlness or larkness, also known as their chronotype, is strongly determined by genetics. If you are a night owl, it\u2019s likely that one (or both) of your parents is a night owl.</p> <p>society treats night owls rather unfairly on two counts. First is the label of being lazy, based on a night owl\u2019s wont to wake up later in the day, due to the fact that they did not fall asleep until the early-morning hours. Others (usually morning larks) will chastise night owls on the erroneous assumption that such preferences are a choice, and if they were not so slovenly, they could easily wake up early. However, night owls are not owls by choice. They are bound to a delayed schedule by unavoidable DNA hardwiring. It is not their conscious fault, but rather their genetic fate.</p> <p>humans likely evolved to co-sleep as families or even whole tribes, not alone or as couples. Appreciating this evolutionary context, the benefits of such genetically programmed variation in sleep/wake timing preferences can be understood. The night owls in the group would not be going to sleep until one or two a.m., and not waking until nine or ten a.m. The morning larks, on the other hand, would have retired for the night at nine p.m. and woken at five a.m. Consequently, the group as a whole is only collectively vulnerable (i.e., every person asleep) for just four rather than eight hours, despite everyone still getting the chance for eight hours of sleep. That\u2019s potentially a 50 percent increase in survival fitness. Mother Nature would never pass on a biological trait\u2014here, the useful variability in when individuals within a collective tribe go to sleep and wake up\u2014that could enhance the survival safety and thus fitness of a species by this amount. And so she hasn\u2019t.</p>"},{"location":"Science/Why%20We%20Sleep.html#have-rhythm-wont-travel","title":"Have Rhythm, Won't Travel","text":"<p>The advent of the jet engine was a revolution for the mass transit of human beings around the planet. However, it created an unforeseen biological calamity: jet planes offered the ability to speed through time zones faster than our twenty-four-hour internal clocks could ever keep up with or adjust to. Those jets caused a biological time lag: jet lag. As a result, we feel tired and sleepy during the day in a distant time zone because our internal clock still thinks it is nighttime. It hasn\u2019t yet caught up. If that were not bad enough, at night, we are frequently unable to initiate or maintain sleep because our internal clock now believes it to be daytime.</p>  \ud83d\udce2 This is jet lag: you feel tired and sleepy during the day in the new time zone because your body clock and associated biology still \u201cthink\u201d it is nighttime. At night, you are frequently unable to sleep solidly because your biological rhythm still believes it to be daytime.   <p>You may have noticed that it feels harder to acclimate to a new time zone when traveling eastward than when flying westward. There are two reasons for this. First, the eastward direction requires that you fall asleep earlier than you would normally, which is a tall biological order for the mind to simply will into action. In contrast, the westward direction requires you to stay up later, which is a consciously and pragmatically easier prospect. Second, you will remember that when shut off from any outside world influences, our natural circadian rhythm is innately longer than one day\u2014about twenty-four hours and fifteen minutes. Modest as this may be, this makes it somewhat easier for you to artificially stretch a day than shrink it. When you travel westward\u2014in the direction of your innately longer internal clock\u2014that \u201cday\u201d is longer than twenty-four hours for you and why it feels a little easier to accommodate to. Eastward travel, however, which involves a \u201cday\u201d that is shorter in length for you than twenty-four hours, goes against the grain of your innately long internal rhythm to start with, which is why it is rather harder to do.</p> <p>West or east, jet lag still places a torturous physiological strain on the brain, and a deep biological stress upon the cells, organs, and major systems of the body. And there are consequences. Scientists have studied airplane cabin crews who frequently fly on long-haul routes and have little chance to recover. Two alarming results have emerged. First, parts of their brains\u2014specifically those related to learning and memory\u2014had physically shrunk, suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of time-zone travel. Second, their short-term memory was significantly impaired. They were considerably more forgetful than individuals of similar age and background who did not frequently travel through time zones. Other studies of pilots, cabin crew members, and shift workers have reported additionally disquieting consequences, including far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes than the general population\u2014or even carefully controlled match individuals who do not travel as much.</p> <p>Recall my flight from San Francisco to London. After arriving that day, I had real difficulty getting to sleep and staying asleep that night. In part, this was because melatonin was not being released during my nighttime in London. My melatonin rise was still many hours away, back on California time. But let\u2019s imagine that I was going to use a legitimate compound of melatonin after arriving in London. Here\u2019s how it works: at around seven to eight p.m. London time I would take a melatonin pill, triggering an artificial rise in circulating melatonin that mimics the natural melatonin spike currently occurring in most of the people in London. As a consequence, my brain is fooled into believing it\u2019s nighttime, and with that chemically induced trick comes the signaled timing of the sleep race. It will still be a struggle to generate the event of sleep itself at this irregular time (for me), but the timing signal does significantly increase the likelihood of sleep in this jet-lagged context.</p>"},{"location":"Science/Why%20We%20Sleep.html#sleep-pressure-and-caffeine","title":"Sleep Pressure and Caffeine","text":"<p>At this very moment, a chemical called adenosine is building up in your brain. It will continue to increase in concentration with every waking minute that elapses. The longer you are awake, the more adenosine will accumulate. Think of adenosine as a chemical barometer that continuously registers the amount of elapsed time since you woke up this morning.</p> <p>One consequence of increasing adenosine in the brain is an increasing desire to sleep. This is known as sleep pressure, and it is the second force that will determine when you feel sleepy, and thus should go to bed. Using a clever dual-action effect, high concentrations of adenosine simultaneously turn down the \u201cvolume\u201d of wake-promoting regions in the brain and turn up the dial on sleep-inducing regions. As a result of that chemical sleep pressure, when adenosine concentrations peak, an irresistible urge for slumber will take hold. It happens to most people after twelve to sixteen hours of being awake.</p> <p>Levels of circulating caffeine peak approximately thirty minutes after oral administration. What is problematic, though, is the persistence of caffeine in your system. In pharmacology, we use the term \u201chalf-life\u201d when discussing a drug\u2019s efficacy. This simply refers to the length of time it takes for the body to remove 50 percent of a drug\u2019s concentration. Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours. Let\u2019s say that you have a cup of coffee after your evening dinner, around 7:30 p.m. This means that by 1:30 a.m., 50 percent of that caffeine may still be active and circulating throughout your brain tissue. In other words, by 1:30 a.m., you\u2019re only halfway to completing the job of cleansing your brain of the caffeine you drank after dinner.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing benign about that 50 percent mark, either. Half a shot of caffeine is still plenty powerful, and much more decomposition work lies ahead throughout the night before caffeine disappears. Sleep will not come easily or be smooth throughout the night as your brain continues its battle against the opposing force of caffeine. Most people do not realize how long it takes to overcome a single dose of caffeine, and therefore fail to make the link between the bad night of sleep we wake from in the morning and the cup of coffee we had ten hours earlier with dinner.</p> <p>Aging also alters the speed of caffeine clearance: the older we are, the longer it takes our brain and body to remove caffeine, and thus the more sensitive we become in later life to caffeine\u2019s sleep-disrupting influence.</p> <p>To impress upon you the effects of caffeine, I footnote esoteric research conducted in the 1980s by NASA. Their scientists exposed spiders to different drugs and then observed the webs that they constructed.X Those drugs included LSD, speed (amphetamine), marijuana, and caffeine. The results, which speak for themselves, can be observed in figure 3. The researchers noted how strikingly incapable the spiders were in constructing anything resembling a normal or logical web that would be of any functional use when given caffeine, even relative to other potent drugs tested.</p>"},{"location":"Science/Why%20We%20Sleep.html#chapter-3-defining-and-generating-sleep","title":"Chapter 3 : Defining and Generating Sleep","text":""},{"location":"Science/Why%20We%20Sleep.html#chapter-4-ape-beds-dinosaurs-and-napping-with-half-a-brain-who-sleeps-how-do-we-sleep-and-how-much","title":"Chapter 4 : Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain : Who sleeps, How do we sleep, and How much?","text":""},{"location":"Science/Why%20We%20Sleep.html#one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other","title":"ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER","text":"<p>Elephants need half as much sleep as humans, requiring just four hours of slumber each day.

The core symptom of autism is a lack of social interaction. Individuals with autism do not communicate or engage with other people easily, or typically.</p> <p>Our current understanding of what causes autism is incomplete, but central to the condition appears to be an inappropriate wiring up of the brain during early developmental life, specifically in the formation and number of synapses\u2014that is, abnormal synaptogenesis. Imbalances in synaptic connections are common in autistic individuals: excess amounts of connectivity in some parts of the brain, deficiencies in others.</p> <p>alcohol can inflict that same selective removal of REM sleep. Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep that we know of. We will discuss the reason that alcohol blocks REM-sleep generation, and the consequences of that sleep disruption in adults, in later chapters. For now, however, we\u2019ll focus on the impact of alcohol</p> <p>That alcohol also dampened the intensity of REM sleep experienced by the fetus, defined by the standard measure of how many darting rapid eye movements adorn the REM-sleep cycle.

Almost half of all lactating women in Western countries consume alcohol in the months during breastfeeding. Alcohol is readily absorbed in a mother\u2019s milk. Concentrations of alcohol in breast milk closely resemble those in a mother\u2019s bloodstream: a 0.08 blood alcohol level in a mother will result in approximately a 0.08 alcohol level in breast milk. Recently we have discovered what alcohol in breast milk does to the sleep of an infant.</p> <p>Newborns will normally transition straight into REM sleep after a feeding. Many mothers already know this: almost as soon as suckling stops, and sometimes even before, the infant\u2019s eyelids will close, and underneath, the eyes will begin darting left-right, indicating that their baby is now being nourished by REM sleep. A once-common myth was that babies sleep better if the mother has had an alcoholic drink before a feeding\u2014beer was the suggested choice of beverage in this old tale. For those of you who are beer lovers, unfortunately, it is just that\u2014a myth. Several studies have fed infants breast milk containing either a non-alcoholic flavor, such as vanilla, or a controlled amount of alcohol (the equivalent of a mother having a drink or two). When babies consume alcohol-laced milk, their sleep is more fragmented, they spend more time awake, and they suffer a 20 to 30 percent suppression of REM sleep soon after. Often, the babies will even try to get back some of that missing REM sleep once they have cleared it from their bloodstream, though it is not easy for their fledgling systems to do so.</p>"},{"location":"Science/Why%20We%20Sleep.html#sleep-and-adolescence","title":"Sleep and Adolescence","text":"<p>Feinberg\u2019s study reminds me of a billboard advertisement I once saw from a large insurance firm, which read: \u201cWhy do most 16-year-olds drive like they\u2019re missing part of their brain?

For fact-based information\u2014or what most of us think of as textbook-type learning, such as memorizing someone\u2019s name, a new phone number, or where you parked your car\u2014a region of the brain called the hippocampus helps apprehend these passing experiences and binds their details together. A long, finger-shaped structure tucked deep on either side of your brain, the hippocampus offers a short-term reservoir, or temporary information store, for accumulating new memories. Unfortunately, the hippocampus has a limited storage capacity, almost like a camera roll or, to use a more modern-day analogy, a USB memory stick. Exceed its capacity and you run the risk of not being able to add more information or, equally bad, overwriting one memory with another: a mishap called interference forgetting.</p> <p>We began testing this theory using daytime naps. We recruited a group of healthy young adults and randomly divided them into a nap group and a no-nap group. At noon, all the participants underwent a rigorous session of learning (one hundred face-name pairs) intended to tax the hippocampus, their short-term memory storage site. As expected, both groups performed at comparable levels. Soon after, the nap group took a ninety-minute siesta in the sleep laboratory with electrodes placed on their heads to measure sleep. The no-nap group stayed awake in the laboratory and performed menial activities, such as browsing the Internet or playing board games. Later that day, at six p.m., all participants performed another round of intensive learning where they tried to cram yet another set of new facts into their short-term storage reservoirs (another one hundred face-name pairs).

They were all photographed twice under identical indoor lighting conditions, same time of day (2:30 p.m.), hair down, no makeup for the women, clean-shaven for the men. What differed, however, was the amount of sleep these individuals were allowed to get before each of the photo shoots.

This surprises many, as it sounds just a little too cold for comfort. Of course, that specific temperature will vary depending on the individual in question and their unique physiology, gender, and age. But like calorie recommendations, it\u2019s a good target for the average human being. Most of us set ambient house and/or bedroom temperatures higher than are optimal for good sleep and this likely contributes to lower quantity and/or quality of sleep than you are otherwise capable of getting. Lower than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.5\u00b0C) can be harmful rather than helpful to sleep, unless warm bedding or nightclothes are used. However, most of us fall into the opposite category of setting a controlled bedroom temperature that is too high: 70 or 72 degrees. Sleep clinicians treating insomnia patients will often ask about room temperature, and will advise patients to drop their current thermostat set-point by 3 to 5 degrees from that which they currently use.</p> <p>Knowingly or not, you have probably used this proven temperature manipulation to help your own sleep. A luxury for many is to draw a hot bath in the evening and soak the body before bedtime. We feel it helps us fall asleep more quickly, which it can, but for the opposite reason most people imagine. You do not fall asleep faster because you are toasty and warm to the core. Instead, the hot bath invites blood to the surface of your skin, giving you that flushed appearance. When you get out of the bath, those dilated blood vessels on the surface quickly help radiate out inner heat, and your core body temperature plummets. Consequently, you fall asleep more quickly because your core is colder. Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.</p>"},{"location":"Science/Why%20We%20Sleep.html#an-alarming-facts","title":"An Alarming Facts","text":"<p>Adding to the harm of evening light and constant temperature, the industrial era inflicted another damaging blow to our sleep: enforced awakening.

Step and repeat this at least five days a week, and you begin to understand the multiplicative abuse your heart and nervous system will suffer across a life span. Waking up at the same time of day, every day, no matter if it is the week or weekend is a good recommendation for maintaining a stable sleep schedule if you are having difficulty with sleep. Indeed, it is one of the most consistent and effective ways of helping people with insomnia get better sleep. This unavoidably means the use of an alarm clock for many individuals.

I find it liberating. I believe my life has value, and I don't want to waste it thinking about clothing,\" Malcolm said. \"I don't want to think about what I will wear in the morning.

It\u2019s a corrosive gas, like fluorine, which is used to etch glass. And when oxygen was first produced as a waste product by certain plant cells\u2014say, around three billion years ago\u2014it created a crisis for all other life on our planet. Those plant cells were polluting the environment with a deadly poison. They were exhaling a lethal gas, and building up its concentration. A planet like Venus has less than one percent oxygen. On earth, the concentration of oxygen was going up rapidly\u2014five, ten, eventually twenty-one percent! Earth had an atmosphere of pure poison! Incompatible with life!\u201d Hammond looked irritated. \u201cSo what is your point? That modern pollutants will be incorporated, too?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cMy point is that life on earth can take care of itself. In the thinking of a human being, a hundred years is a long time. A hundred years ago, we didn\u2019t have cars and airplanes and computers and vaccines.\u2026 It was a whole different world. But to the earth, a hundred years is nothing. A million years is nothing. This planet lives and breathes on a much vaster scale. We can\u2019t imagine its slow and powerful rhythms, and we haven\u2019t got the humility to try. We have been residents here for the blink of an eye. If we are gone tomorrow, the earth will not miss us.\u201d \u2015\u00a0Michael Crichton,\u00a0Jurassic Park   <p>\u201cWhether it was Disney or the Navy, management guys always behaved the same. They never understood the technical issues; and they thought that screaming was the way to make things happen. And maybe it was, if you were shouting at your secretaries to get you a limousine. But screaming didn\u2019t make any difference at all to the problems that Arnold now faced. The computer didn\u2019t care if it was screamed at. The power network didn\u2019t care if it was screamed at. Technical systems were completely indifferent to all this explosive human emotion. If anything, screaming was counterproductive, because Arnold now faced the virtual certainty that Nedry wasn\u2019t coming back, which meant that Arnold himself had to go into the computer code and try and figure out what had gone wrong. It was going to be a painstaking job; he\u2019d need to be calm and careful.\u201d \u2015\u00a0Michael Crichton,\u00a0Jurassic Park</p>"},{"location":"Science%20Fiction/Old%20Man%27s%20War.html","title":"Old Man's War by John Scalzi","text":"<p>\u201cI hate that I\u2019ve become one of those old men who visits a cemetery to be with his dead wife.

When you observe a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently.</p> <p>happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As Caed Budris says, </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d </p> <p>Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it.</p> <p>Emotions drive behavior. Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes before response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.</p> <p>We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional. The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first response\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe fast, nonconscious portion of the brain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe slow, conscious portion of the brain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis the part that does the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thinking.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d</p> <p>Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality only intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional thinking when they are not.</p> <p>Suffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack ambition.</p> <p>Your actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really want it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.</p> <p>Our expectations determine our satisfaction. The gap between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the future. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so. </p> <p>For example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your expectation changes your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high expectations is a disappointment. An average experience preceded by low expectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are approximately the same, you feel satisfied. </p> \\[ Satisfaction = Liking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Wanting \\] <p>This is the wisdom behind Seneca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous quote, </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d </p> <p>If your wants outpace your likes, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always be unsatisfied.

The organization, which was the governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity. Since 1908, British riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even worse in cycling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest race, the Tour de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event. In fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear. Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the aggregation of marginal gains,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d</p> <p>Brailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you might expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the bike seats to make them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better grip. They asked riders to wear electrically heated overshorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each athlete responded to a particular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which proved to be lighter and more aerodynamic. But they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find 1 percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They tested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle recovery. They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. They determined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes. As these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated, the results came faster than anyone could have imagined.</p> <p>Just five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team dominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games came to London, the Brits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records and seven world records. That same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froome won the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the British team five Tour de France victories in six years. During the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured five Tour de France victories in what is widely regarded as the most successful run in cycling history.*</p>"},{"location":"Self%20Help/Atomic%20Habits.html#why-small-changes-make-big-difference","title":"Why Small changes make big difference","text":"\u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00a1 1% BETTER EVERY DAY 1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03 **1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78**   <p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss small changes because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.

You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed who you are.</p> <p>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one thing to say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the type of person who wants this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something very different to say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the type of person who is this.</p> <p>The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re proud of how your hair looks, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re proud of the size of your biceps, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re proud of the scarves you knit, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.</p> <p>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.</p> <p>for Example</p> <ul> <li>The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.</li> <li>The goal is not to run marathon but become a runner.</li> </ul> <p>Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are\u00e2\u20ac\u201deither consciously or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. For example, people who identified as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153being a voter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d were more likely to vote than those who simply claimed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153voting\u00e2\u20ac\u009d was an action they wanted to perform. Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.</p> <p>The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level\u00e2\u20ac\u201dindividual, team, society\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.</p> <p>On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning.

The box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by some simple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food. </p> <p>Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door would open, and they would escape. </p> <p>Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food. </p> <p>After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example, Thorndike noted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act. 160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d </p> <p>During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes.

The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cat, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just trying things out to see what works.</p> <p>Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action. </p> <p>Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run calms you down. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that playing video games relaxes you. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re exploring, exploring, exploring, and then\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBAM\u00e2\u20ac\u201da reward.</p> <p>After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward. Wait a minute\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat felt good. What did I do right before that? This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a habit forming.</p> <p>Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly. As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d </p> <p>As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choice that once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created.</p> <p>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.</p> <p>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.</p> <p>Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re behind the curve. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhen should I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthen you have less time for freedom.

When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Signal is green.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All clear!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.* </p> <p>This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes.

Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you.</p> <p>In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).</p> <p>It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long for Lewin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Equation to be tested in business. In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d In other words, customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them but because of how they are presented to them. </p> <p>For example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than those down near the floor. For this reason, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find expensive brand names featured in easy-to-reach locations on store shelves because they drive the most profit, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away in harder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which are the units at the end of aisles. End caps are moneymaking machines for retailers because they are obvious locations that encounter a lot of foot traffic. For example, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come specifically from end-of-the-aisle racks. </p> <p>The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and visit Starbucks because it is on every corner. We like to think that we are in control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted to do so. The truth, however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.</p> <p>In humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system. We perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. But we also have other ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious, but many are nonconscious. For instance, you can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153notice\u00e2\u20ac\u009d when the temperature drops before a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a stomachache, or when you fall off balance while walking on rocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide range of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your blood or the need to drink when thirsty.</p> <p>The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the brain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resources are used on vision. Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.</p>"},{"location":"Self%20Help/Atomic%20Habits.html#chapter-7-the-secret-to-self-control","title":"Chapter 7 : The Secret to Self Control","text":"<p>You can break a habit, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to forget it.

The children would play against each other constantly and compete in the best tournaments they could find. The family would keep a meticulous file system of the tournament history of every competitor the children faced. Their lives would be dedicated to chess. </p> <p>Laszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the Polgars were parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit. </p> <p>Susan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old.

Out of all the possible actions we could take, the one that is realized is the one that delivers the most value for the least effort.

To experience flow, it is necessary that your skills in a given task match the challenge at hand. If the challenge exceeds your requisite skill level, you will experience anxiety, and if your skills exceed the challenge, you will most likely feel bored during the activity. Flow is usually accompanied by complete concentration on the given task, and you typically feel in control and have clear goals in sight. Individuals in flow generally have an idea of what is coming next and receive immediate feedback throughout the task. They also experience a merging of action and awareness, during which they lose both their self-consciousness and their sense of time. They are usually intrinsically motivated, performing an activity for its own sake and not for an external reward. Those in flow often are performing at an optimal level and are completely absorbed in what they are doing. Once individuals have experienced flow, they are often compelled to repeat the activities that enabled them to experience it.*</p>"},{"location":"Self%20Help/How%20to%20Win%20Friends%20and%20Influence%20People.html","title":"How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie","text":"<p>Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself.

Today I can tell you unhesitatingly what is: my husband and sons; writing; promoting the values of this book. Once I realized this, I had to make a change. I look back on my years as a Wall Street lawyer as time spent in a foreign country. It was absorbing, it was exciting, and I got to meet a lot of interesting people whom I never would have known otherwise. But I was always an expatriate. Having spent so much time navigating my own career transition and counseling others through theirs, I have found that there are three key steps to identifying your own core personal projects.</p> <p>First, think back to what you loved to do when you were a child. How did you answer the question of what you wanted to be when you grew up? The specific answer you gave may have been off the mark, but the underlying impulse was not. If you wanted to be a fireman, what did a fireman mean to you? A good man who rescued people in distress? A daredevil? Or the simple pleasure of operating a truck? If you wanted to be a dancer, was it because you got to wear a costume, or because you craved applause, or was it the pure joy of twirling around at lightning speed? You may have known more about who you were then than you do now. Second, pay attention to the work you gravitate to. </p> <p>Example</p> <p>\ud83d\udca1 At my law firm I never once volunteered to take on an extra corporate legal assignment, but I did spend a lot of time doing pro bono work for a nonprofit women\u2019s leadership organization. I also sat on several law firm committees dedicated to mentoring, training, and personal development for young lawyers in the firm. Now, as you can probably tell from this book, I am not the committee type. But the goals of those committees lit me up, so that\u2019s what I did.</p> <p>Finally, pay attention to what you envy. Jealousy is an ugly emotion, but it tells the truth. You mostly envy those who have what you desire. I met my own envy after some of my former law school classmates got together and compared notes on alumni career tracks. They spoke with admiration and, yes, jealousy, of a classmate who argued regularly before the Supreme Court. At first I felt critical. More power to that classmate! I thought, congratulating myself on my magnanimity. Then I realized that my largesse came cheap, because I didn\u2019t aspire to argue a case before the Supreme Court, or to any of the other accolades of lawyering. When I asked myself whom I did envy, the answer came back instantly. My college classmates who\u2019d grown up to be writers or psychologists. Today I\u2019m pursuing my own version of both those roles. </p> <p>Johnson, who is a frequent public speaker on education despite a lifelong public speaking phobia, knows firsthand how well this works. \u201cI haven\u2019t overcome my shyness,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is sitting in the corner, calling to me. But I am passionate about changing our schools, so my passion overcomes my shyness once I get started on a speech. If you find something that arouses your passion or provides a welcome challenge, you forget yourself for a while. It\u2019s like an emotional vacation.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Self%20Help/Show%20Your%20Work.html","title":"Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered by Austin Kleon","text":""},{"location":"Self%20Help/Show%20Your%20Work.html#quotes","title":"\ud83d\udcd5 Quotes","text":"<p>\"For Artists, the Great problem to solve is how to get oneself noticed\" - Honopre De Balzac</p> <p>It sounds a little extreme, but in this day and age, if your work isn\u2019t online, it doesn\u2019t exist.

These people aren\u2019t schmoozing at cocktail parties; they\u2019re too busy for that. They\u2019re cranking away in their studios, their laboratories, or their cubicles, but instead of maintaining absolute secrecy and hoarding their work, they\u2019re open about what they\u2019re working on, and they\u2019re consistently posting bits and pieces of their work, their ideas, and what they\u2019re learning online. Instead of wasting their time \u201cnetworking,\u201d they\u2019re taking advantage of the network.

To someone, it may be better than you dare to think.\u201d \u2014Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p> <p>There are a lot of destructive myths about creativity, but one of the most dangerous is the \u201clone genius\u201d myth: An individual with superhuman talents appears out of nowhere at certain points in history, free of influences or precedent, with a direct connection to God or The Muse. When inspiration comes, it strikes like a lightning bolt, a lightbulb switches on in his head, and then he spends the rest of his time toiling away in his studio, shaping this idea into a finished masterpiece that he releases into the world to great fanfare. If you believe in the lone genius myth, creativity is an antisocial act, performed by only a few great figures\u2014mostly dead men with names like Mozart, Einstein, or Picasso. The rest of us are left to stand around and gawk in awe at their achievements.</p> <p>There\u2019s a healthier way of thinking about creativity that the musician Brian Eno refers to as \u201cscenius.\u201d Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals\u2014artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers\u2014who make up an \u201cecology of talent.\u201d</p> <p>If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of \u201ca whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other\u2019s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.\u201d Scenius doesn\u2019t take away from the achievements of those great individuals; it just acknowledges that good work isn\u2019t created in a vacuum, and that creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds.</p> <p>What I love about the idea of scenius is that it makes room in the story of creativity for the rest of us: the people who don\u2019t consider ourselves geniuses. Being a valuable part of a scenius is not necessarily about how smart or talented you are, but about what you have to contribute\u2014the ideas you share, the quality of the connections you make, and the conversations you start. If we forget about genius and think more about how we can nurture and contribute to a scenius, we can adjust our own expectations and the expectations of the worlds we want to accept us. We can stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others.</p> <p>We live in an age where it\u2019s easier than ever to join a scenius. The Internet is basically a bunch of sceniuses connected together, divorced from physical geography. Blogs, social media sites, email groups, discussion boards, forums\u2014they\u2019re all the same thing: virtual scenes where people go to hang out and talk about the things they care about. There\u2019s no bouncer, no gatekeeper, and no barrier to entering these scenes: You don\u2019t have to be rich, you don\u2019t have to be famous, and you don\u2019t have to have a fancy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or a degree from an expensive school.

Certain stocks began to resist the downward trend. They still fell, but while the majority dropped easily, following the mood of the general market, these stocks gave ground grudgingly. I could almost feel their reluctance. On closer examination, I found the majority of these were companies whose earnings trends pointed sharply upward. The conclusion was obvious: capital was flowing into these stocks, even in a bad market. This capital was following earning improvements as a dog follows a scent. This discovery opened my eyes to a completely new perspective. I saw that it is true that stocks are the slaves of earning power. Consequently, I decided that while there may be many reasons behind any stock movement, I would look only for one: improving earning power or anticipation of it. To do that, I would marry my technical approach to the fundamental one. I would select stocks on their technical action in the market, but I would only buy them when I could give improving earning power as my fundamental reason for doing so.</p> <p>As I flew around the world, I was constantly searching for stocks that would climb into the stratosphere because of the vision of their future. This attitude was a preparation for what I suppose you could call high-territory trading. I looked for stocks that I thought could make new highs and I decided to give them my full attention when they had climbed on to the launching pad and were preparing to rocket up. Now these stocks would be more expensive than ever before and so they would look too dear to the uninitiated. But they could become dearer. I made up my mind to buy high and sell higher.</p> <p>The truth was that as my pocket had strengthened, my head had weakened. I became over-confident, and that is the most dangerous state of mind anyone can develop in the stock market.

He had learned this lesson and profited handsomely during the 1907 market, as he noticed the exact same type of behaviour leading stocks toping and then starting to break down without bounce back in price. this topping action in market leading stocks will repeat itself over and over in coming decades when other market peaks have been reached.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Trade/How%20Legendary%20Traders%20Made%20Millions.html#1917-18","title":"1917-18","text":"<ul> <li>1917 start with rumor that us will enter the war and market became more volatile in first few months</li> <li>on 6th april 1917, Us entered world war 1 and market started it\u2019s downtrend.</li> <li>The best traders throughout history sell their stocks when they begin to crumble, and they make sure to take their profits and not ride a stock all the way back down again.</li> <li>Right at end of 1917 market bottomed and began moving higher in first two months of 1918 , market began choppy range again and would continue that way until summer.

He noticed that after the war ended, that there were many more industries vying for the lead in the market. This was in contrast to the preceding decade when really only handful of industries seemed to lead most market upward cycles.</li> <li>As the market  kept falling further in early in 1921 and the recession continue to drag on, there were a few bright points. for one, president Harding began his administration and his republican status was viewed as more business friendly than that of his predecessor. Also federal reserve began to lower interest rates. here we see again the market falling for somewhat for prolonged  period of time and many possibly giving up on the market when in fact what was happening was the market was just beginning to shake off the decline and begin one of its greatest moves in market history. by June the market had began to flatten out, and by july the recession would officially end. we have seen instances of this in prior decades - a flattening out of the market after a prolonged decline and the end of a recession period. Combined with easing of interest rates, an economy thatt was beginning to broaden in terms of industries and consumption starting to improve, the market was looking ahead to better times.</li> <li>The year 1921 would sever as pivotal point in the economy as it  started to strengthen with accommodative policies. In fact, the federal reserve would lower interest rates to 4.5% by year end. this was quite a reduction since they stood at 7% earlier in that year.</li> <li>During this time Famous trader Gerald Loeb was really beginning his personal operations in the market. He started with 25000$ which he inherited from his father. In early 1923 loeb bought a tip from someone and put everything he had into auto stock. He bought 5000 shares with 10x leverage because margin was cheap at that  time. Shortly after purchase stock began to decline and the market topped and began slight correction. As stock continue to fall loeb refused to sell. In end loeb lost his all money in single trade. He again took 10000$ from his mom by selling some jewelry. Again he bought something from tip and lost everything again.</li> <li>This second loss taught him one of the most valuable lessons for success in the market- do your own research. and with time, research and experience will lead one to better judgement. Loeb would later say that those first two major early losses for him were keys to why he did not lose money in the great crash of 1929. As we know, it takes losses in the stock market to make future great traders. when it comes to the stock market, perseverance is  one of the best traits to have, and learning from mistakes is one of the best teachers.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Trade/How%20Legendary%20Traders%20Made%20Millions.html#1927-1929","title":"1927-1929","text":"<ul> <li>It was in 1927 that leob began to really notice how psychology and crowd behaviour played a major role in the market and how certain wall street valuation methods didn\u2019t matter as much. For example, every stock he purchased in 1927 was based purely on fundamentals and a model he would use to value stocks. as his stocks rose to higher levels he sold them because his models informed him that the prices had reached an overvalued basis. what he noticed however was that once he sold them they continued to rise in price due to the strong trend of the market during that time. he then came right back into the market and bought  them again. this understanding of how crowd psychology worked was the exact same discovery that livermore and baruch had learned in their early years.</li> <li>From the near end of july at just above 200, the market surged through november to near 300 with only month of rest.

He kept his head and didn\u2019t get too exited. this is part of the critical emotional control that the best traders employ</li> <li>Bernard Baruch, however, seemed to get more caught up in the exitement. He acutually moved his offices closer to wall street, a mistake of getting too wrapped up in the action. We will see this happen to nicolas darvas as well in the late 1950s. Though baruch was extremely bullish on america\u2019s prospects for the future, he would start to feel uneasy about the market rapid increase in share prices, and mention few times that prices seemed exceedingly high. He was astute observer of crowd psychology and he studied it well. he knew that a mob type behavior was somwhat responsible for this rise of market. he did sell out of his positions a few times during the rapid run up in prices, as he liked to sell his winners on the way up. Repeatadly in market operations i have sold stock while it was rising and that\u2019s is one reason i have held on my fortune. But each time he sold in 1928 the market kept moving higher.</li> <li>A sharp pullback occurredd in November 1928, but it didn\u2019t last long as the market shot right back up again in december and finished the year near 300. The 1928 gain was solid 48%.</li> <li>The federal reserve began to get concerned aboutt the rapidly rising market and began to raise interest rates to cub some of speculative buying. they raised rates form 3.5% to 5% from end of 1928</li> <li>1929 started off with another buying frenzy. From there it would mostly whipsaw action (up and down) still may end as bulls found a fight with some cashing in their profits.</li> <li>A continued strong demand for margin money raised those rates to 12%. Even at those high rates, people thought that since the market was risign so fast, their returns on the increase in stock prices would dwarf the higher margin rates they were being charged.</li> <li>Consumption by consumers stayed strong, as the gross nation product risen by 50% since 1921. It\u2019s remarkable incrase in many respects from an aconomic standpoint. worker productivity had incresed by some 40% during the time frame 1921-1929. Buing on credit, advertising and consumption were all rising. it was clearly continuing to be the roaring 20s, and most everyone was caught u pin it and excited about continued prosperity.</li> <li>By the summer of 1929 many of the mroe active and astute traders of the day would again be questioning the euphoric rise in stock prices. Livermore was beginning his probing on the short side looking for a top. He remember his successful experience in 1907 to know that all markets don\u2019t go straight up forever.</li> <li>barush by august when the market was rising so fast would buy stock one day and then turn around and sell profits the next day. as the market kept shooting up he would continue this fast paced trading, though he had sold out most of his positions on the way up prior to this. baruch near this time became really suspicious when beggars and shoeshine boys began offering stock tips. the action of mob psychology was in full force, as more people where racing to get in the markets. Many would leave their jobs during the day and just watch the tape in brokerage houses or at the exchange</li> <li>by mid 1929, because of demand, the broker rates for margin loans was near 20%, quite an increase from where they were just two years earlier at 3.5%. Because of this high demand for money and the attractive rates in the market, corporations even started lending money to consumers for securities purchases. Money was being funnelled into speculative stock purchases and being directed away from productive capital investments that could eventually create new jobs adn opportunities.</li> <li>A sharp spike upward in the market in june was followed by only pause in july, and then the final climax run began in august. By this time many leading stocks were rising in dramatic fashion in what is callled \u201cclassic climax run\u201d</li> <li>Volume on exchange was also rising. One curious divergence that was occurring for the astute observer was that economic conditions were slowing down even though optimism was running at an all time high. auto and construction figures that were coming out were all down. also european stocks had already began to fall. in august an official recession set in and this would be first time that market would actually rise and keep rising just before and right into the beginning for new recession.</li> <li>The peak close of the market was around 381.15. this from 200 in June of 1928. 90% up in 14 months. The market nearly quadrapled from the point of when it started its historic run in late 1924. Here now are some of the interesting details of how that market topped and gave out plenty of cues before it really started to sink. Some smart money began to sell in September, and some of the best traders in history were either liquidating their stock holdings and retaining their profits or beginning to sell short. Remember that a key trait of the very best traders is their ability to control their emotions. The difficulty in not getting too caught up in the hysteria but following sound judgment and using experience from either prior mistakes or successes is a main reason why so few are able to conduct sustained profitable operations in the market.</li> <li>After the market peaked in early september, heavy selling  began to set in and actually became quite common. this is a very strong signal that gradually smart money ws leaving the market. the dow average suffered five declines on heavy volume throught September. we will see as we go along that if for numerous days after the market hits a high, heavy selling begins to build and continue, the markets will start major correction phases. this action and pattern has repeated itself time and time again through market history. all this selling during September was occurring a full month before the bottom fell out. it was clear that the price action of stocks, especially the leaders, and the volume activity that was taking place were causing a change in general trend of the market.</li> <li>After fall in September, a sharp rise on October 6 calmed some nerves on the street. However, the big and astute selling traders were not quite finished yet. as trading began to slow down a bit, more economic report came out showing continued weakness. stell production was poor and construction figures continued to weaken. also momentum of the October rebound was short lived. after sharp fall one good day is not enough to turn around what was becoming a new direction in the overall trend of market. in late October stocks sank again and leading stocks were taking more hits. People then started getting more concerned, and many started talking about the panic of 1907. but many thought that, due to federal reserve, more established leadership in the market, and previous experience form 1907, an event like that could not occur again. +</li> <li> <p>Livermore remembered 1907, and his thoughts were that since human emotions are involved, an event like that could happen again no matter what was in place. his memory of his actions and the market during that time helped him tremendously during this current time. on Saturday market fell again with heavy volume. this was the first day that heavy margin calls were being placed by brokerage houses. also, rumors started to circulate that jesse livermore might be responsible for the selling and that he was trying to pound the market lower. by that time though, he had already established plenty of short positions in the market since he had seen the change in trend to the downside weeks before</p> </li> <li> <p>In short in few months market lost 1.5 years of gain. If one hadn\u2019t sold correctly. by the end of november a mild rally brought  stock up off their low point for the year and breathed some life back to market. This clearly show that market don\u2019t go straight up or straight down, but clearly the longer term trend had changed</p> </li> <li>Livermore, Kennedy and Loeb were mostly out of their long holdings by the time the end fo october came around. their astuteness and observation skills, while keeping their emotions in check, are just a few of the key successful traits of the great traders.<ul> <li>Baruch sold because he began to get bit uncomfortable with high prices and also because he liked to sell on the way up</li> <li>Livermore, through his short positions, netted another multimillion dollar profit when he finally closed those positions, just as he had done in prior market tops</li> <li>Gerald Loeb belied strongly that stocks had risen to unrecorded and overvaluation statuses. a few instances alerted him to this conclusion. One leading stocks had topped and then began to fall from their peak prices. another was that tips were flying everywhere, which is what Baruch also discovered and alerted him to be more cautious as well. He sold out of all his positions in early october and 100% in cash three weeks before the major damange was occur.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Trade/How%20Legendary%20Traders%20Made%20Millions.html#4-patience-and-flexibility-1930-39","title":"4: Patience and Flexibility (1930-39)","text":""},{"location":"Trade/How%20Legendary%20Traders%20Made%20Millions.html#loeb-quick-trades-on-upturn","title":"Loeb Quick Trades on Upturn","text":"<ul> <li>1930 started off with the market sprinting higher from january through mid april as it rose back up to near the 300 level.</li> <li>Loeb was back from his vacation and remained active and attuned to the market.

On December 7, Japan attacked pearl harbor.

O\u2019Neil would notice these through his intense study and observation: He in fact was trying to get all his institutional clients to sell stocks and raise cash.</p> <ul> <li>Boeing : From near 20$ per share in January 1964, boing was the leader rising the increased demand for aircraft manufacturing. the moved up strong throughout 1964, 1965 and the very beginning of 1966. By april 1966 the stock had reached 91 per share with 350% gain in two years. after topping with the market and forming a classic head and shoulders pattern, boeing started to break down and sell off on heavy volume. Many who had gained strong returns on this leader were cashing in their profits. the stock had undercut previous level of support (50 day moving average) and it was accompanied by heavy volume.  And by October it was 44% off from its top.</li> <li>Motorola : another leading stock rose up to 215%. It was also topped in the same head and shoulders pattern as boeing at about same time. Volume increased notieably on the downside, the stock broke through areas it had not violated before, the market\u2019s trend had changed, and other leading stocks were following the same pattern. By october motorola was down 55% from it\u2019s high</li> </ul> <p>While many readers may point out that it\u2019s easy to pinpoint tops and bottoms and calculate percentage ups and downs when looking from a historical perspective, as compared to making he proper decisions in the market at that exact time, it is important to learn that many of these same patterns in the market and in stocks do occur over again. also, many of these great traders understood this, and this is how they made decisions that lead to their incredible gains.</p> <p>Nobody is every going to be able to buy at the exact bottom and then sell at the exact top. but the best traders used signals like these to at least help increase the returns when the market would turn upward and then lessen the damage when things tuned the other way as they did in early 1966.</p> <p>By late april with many leaders topping like we saw earlier, the market would begin its downtrend as the direction of the market had clearly changed. There were other leaders topping as well, so it would have been somewhat clear to an experienced stock market operator that things had turned. Simmons precision, which was in the aerospace computer market and was one of the best performing groups of 1965, also topped. </p> <p>With Vietnam growing to be more of a concern and the market topping out, the dow headed lower throughout the spring, summer, and early fall. Dow fell nearly 27%, in just under 6 months. it was a major correction in such a short period of time, and those market breaks can cause monetary and emotional damage to trader unless the trader heeds the market\u2019s signals and takes appropriate action. No one knows just how bad a correction can get, so the best thing to do in a topping market is to sell stocks and go to cash. Or short formal leaders if you\u2019re experienced enough.

Your order isn't in and the stock ends up running away from you. Every market veteran has had this experience.

But do you want to purchase it? Not necessarily. Even though the probabilities are very strong that this stock is going to advance and you'll make money, that isn't enough. At first this may sound crazy to you. I wouldn't be surprised to hear you say, \"What is Stan talking about? I've bought a bunch of dogs that have gone down before I've gotten my confirmation slip. Now he's telling me that this stock is going to advance and I shouldn't buy it!\u201d</p> <p>There's a concept in economics called opportunity costs which applies perfectly here. Taking away all of the fancy ivory-tower jargon, it means that we all have limited resources, whether it be $25,000 or $25 million. So we must maximize our resources-which, in this case, is your market stake. If we buy stock XYZ and it advances 20 percent, but stock ABC in the same time period gains 200 percent, we have actually lost profit-making potential. Therefore, what we want to do is to uncover the A + stocks and play those while leaving the Bs and Cs alone for others.</p> <p>Now go back to Chart 4-1 and I'll show you why this is a B - buy. Once XYZ gives a positive signal by breaking out above 15 resistance, you must look at where the next area of resistance is. It's 18, which was the floor ofsupport from the prior trading range. Remember that support, once broken, later becomes resistance when the stock rallies back to that level. If XYZ does overcome that resistance it will find the going very tough all the way up to 20. So the entire 18 to 20 area presents significant potential resistance. That doesn't mean the stock will never overcome that area. What it does mean is that it will use up a great amount of buying power to get through this zone. So it will most likely stall in that area for quite a while. Even in the unlikely event that it gets past the resistance in a hurry, it will be tired and need to regroup. It's no different from someone who has to climb six flights of stairs to get to their apartment versus another person who can simply take an elevator. Who is obviously going to have more energy left? It's the same with stocks. If stock XYZ and ABC both stage breakouts and then benefit from 500,000 shares of buying in the next several sessions, which one is going to go further? The one with little or no resistance in its path, or the one with plenty of overhead supply? The answer is obvious.</p> <p>So now let's look at Chart 4-2 of stock ABC. It's in the same group as XYZ and is also breaking out above resistance and its MA. But whereas XYZ had a clear zone of resistance just a few points overhead, ABC has no overhead resistance on the chart. While it may have traded at higher prices, it hasn't done so in the past 2-plus years. (The Mansfield chart shows the history for about 2V2 years.) While resistance is still in existence even from several years ago, my studies have shown that the older the resistance, the less potent it is. This makes sense since resistance is created by sellers who bought at higher prices and want to get out close to their purchase price after the stock declines. As time passes, more and more investors take their losses at the end of each trading year.

If your market assets are allocated among 50 stocks, it is very difficult to get a feel for how each one is acting. In addition, there is the tendency to concentrate on the issues that are acting well and put aside your concern about the laggards, figuring they will come to life later. What happens is that you let the good stocks subsidize the bad ones.</p> <p>The proper way to look at your stocks is to make believe that each position is the only one you have. If it's acting fine, great, ride with it. But if it's lagging badly and acting poorly, lighten up on that position even if the sell-stop isn't hit. Move the proceeds into a new Stage 2 stock with greater promise. To be more specific, for a small portfolio that's investing a modest amount ($10,000 to $25,000), I'd diversify into no more than five or six stocks. But as you move up the ladder into six-digit or higher portfolios, ]0 to 20 stocks are the most that I'd invest in at anyone time. Also, use approximately equal dollar amounts when constructing your portfolio.</p> <p>Don't do all of your buying from just one group. If three or four sectors exhibit great technical action, buy Stage 2 breakouts from all of them rather than from only group A. If one group suddenly reverses, your portfolio will still do well. If you practice these two forms of diversification and properly utilize my system, you should do very well in the market year in and year out!</p>"},{"location":"Trade/Secrets%20For%20Profiting%20in%20Bull%20and%20Bear%20Markets.html#5-uncovering-exceptional-winners","title":"5: Uncovering exceptional winners","text":"<p>First, let's examine the takeover dream which, for most investors, leads to financial nightmares. I've seen investors buy on rumor after rumor and have not one deal pan out. Some terrible losses can pile up while they wait for the announcement that never comes. Why do so many investors chase these rainbows? It's a simple study in psychology. First, there's greed. We all want to hit that big gusher in a hurry, so we dream that maybe this time our ship will come in. Second, there's a theory in psychology called intermittent reinforcement. It says that if an animal gets what it wants, even in a small percentage of the cases, it will keep coming back for more. It's been demonstrated time and again that if a mouse gets cheese just once when going through a maze, it will try to navigate that maze over and over again, even when the cheese is no longer there. People aren't that different from animals. Why else would we play the slot machines in Las Vegas or try to win a lottery? All it takes is one jackpot going off in the casino, or one lottery winner in the headlines, and we start dreaming again.</p> <p>Here a bit of mathematics comes into play. If you have $50,000 invested and you lose 20 percent, you are now reduced to a $40,000 market stake. To get back to even you now need a 25 percent gain on your next trade. And if this trade is a loser, then the percentages move even further against you. So discipline and selectivity are operative words to always keep in mind. Remember, we can make really big money in the market even if we pass up 100 winners and buy only 10 stocks during the year, with 7 or 8 turning out to be winners.</p>"},{"location":"Trade/Secrets%20For%20Profiting%20in%20Bull%20and%20Bear%20Markets.html#the-triple-confirmation-pattern","title":"THE TRIPLE CONFIRMATION PATTERN","text":"<p>In addition to the basic requirements of the stock being above the MA, the following three events must take place. First, there must be a volume signal. This is vital! The market champs almost always have substantially larger volume on the breakout than during any point in the Stage 1 base area. For this type of big winner we want to see volume of even more than twice the average trading of the past four weeks. In addition, the heavy volume should not be shortlived. The initial volume surge should be followed by several more weeks of heavy trading. This signal indicates a sudden tremendous interest in the stock, as well as additional future demand. Since the stock is starting to run away on the upside, buyers will be fast to add to positions on any corrections. When the dips are too shallow to accommodate their buying, these buyers will often get into a buying panic.</p> <p>The second factor to focus on is relative strength (B on Chart 5-15). This is a very important tool to use in distinguishing good from great buys. For this triple-threat pattern, the RS line must be in a certain position. It should either be in negative territory or hugging the zero line in a neutral manner.</p> <p>If a stock has wide swings while still in its Stage I base pattern, then it's far more likely to be a ball of fire once it breaks out. Just as a high jumper gets into a low crouch before taking off up-ward, a stock that first dips and then gets up a good head of steam will be far more powerful once it leaves the starting gate. As a rule of thumb, stocks that have risen some 40 to 50 percent or more before breaking out do the best in the months ahead. But this does add some near-term risk to the breakout, which is why I stressed earlier that this kind of buying is strictly for investors rather than traders</p>"},{"location":"Trade/Secrets%20For%20Profiting%20in%20Bull%20and%20Bear%20Markets.html#6-when-to-sell","title":"6: When to Sell","text":""},{"location":"Trade/Secrets%20For%20Profiting%20in%20Bull%20and%20Bear%20Markets.html#donts-for-selling","title":"DON'TS FOR SELLING","text":"<ol> <li>Don't base your selling decision on tax considerations. This is truly a case of letting the tail wag the dog. Too often an investor will decide that he can't sell a given stock because there is too big a tax bite. Then in the following months the stock plummets and wipes out a good portion of the profit. This decline, if avoided, could have paid for the taxes and still have left a good gain. Furthermore, you then could have moved into a new Stage 2 situation that had the potential to rack up an additional gain.</li> <li>Don't base your selling decision on how much the stock is yielding. Far too often, investors decide to hold onto a stock that is weakening because it pays a great dividend. This type of thinking is especially common when dealing with utility stocks, which typically offer a generous yield. It's great to hold onto these stocks while they are in Stage 2. Even though they won't usually rocket ahead, they are good total-return situations (price appreciation plus yield) that certainly beat the 5V2 percent yield of the bank. But once these stocks move into Stage 4 and start heading south, it's ridiculous to hold onto them any more than you would hold any other Stage 4 loser. Remember, if you get a 10 percent yield but lose 20 percent because of price depreciation, that's not winning mathematics. And that's the good news. It could be worse. There's always the distinct possibility that the plunge in stock price is a signal of future bad economic news for the firm. The news may be so negative that the company may not even have the ability to pay future dividends at all.</li> <li>Don't hold onto a stock because the pricelearnings (PIE) ratio is low. This ratio often appears to be at a bargain level even though your stock is topping out. The stock often declines and only months later reports disappointing earnings. By this time the PIE ratio no longer appears low at all, but at that point it is too late to sell profitably. In addition, there are many cases where the PIE ratio is low-and stays low-and the stock gets bashed anyway.</li> <li>Don't seLL a stock simply because the PIE is too high. The converse of the prior example is also a serious problem. There's an old Wall Street joke that has an investor ask his broker why a given stock went up. For lack of a better explanation, the broker quips \"more buyers than sellers.\" There's more truth than fiction to the message behind that joke, but few investors ever learn it. They always want rational answers why a stock moves. They are really getting either excuses or conjecture. Few market participants ever learn that the market isn't always rational. All it does is reflect the prevailing psychology or mood ofinvestors. Ifinvestors become overly bullish and lapse into optimistic dreams, then high PIEs can go much higher. Tandem Computers (Chart 6-8) illustrates this point clearly. The PIE ratio of 32 was no bargain in late 1985 when TDM moved above resistance at 10 (point A). Fifteen months later, it was an even higher 44 as the stock price neared the 38 level.  Investors are like manic-depressives: when they become optimistic, they'll find excuses to buy stocks no matter how high the PIE gets. On the other hand, when they become bearish and worried, they will shy away from buying no matter how cheap the PIE appears. So the secret is to accept that too high can become much higher when a stock is in Stage 2, and hold back on your selling until you see the whites of their eyes and Stage 3 starts to form. This is far more important than too high a PIE, because it objectively shows that the very powerful buying which catapulted your stock higher is now finally meeting equally powerful selling. It is not the fuzzy concept of being overvalued that causes a stock to top out, but the measurable reality that supply finally equals demand.</li> <li>Don't average down in a negative situation. These are stocks that had moved into Stage 4 and should have been sold. Unfortunately, many investors fell into the fundamentals trap. First they held on because it was a good company or so they thought. When they realized they were in trouble, they determined to get out even on the next rally. This is market masochism at its worst. In so many Stage 4 bombings, the stock never gives you the opportunity to come close to getting out even. Then panic takes over and these ill-starred investors shoot themselves in the foot by averaging down.\" This technique is great in theory, but suicidal in practice. Those who practice this dangerous technique are courting financial disaster. Don't ever fall into the seductive trap ofthinking that by buying more at a lower price, the stock will only have to rally half as much before you get out even. Do as professionals do-average up, not  down. When market action starts to show them they are right, the pros pile on further-not when they've been proven wrong. Instead ofsitting on a problem stock, they get out promptly. Learning how to handle a losing situation and keeping losses to a minimum is one of the most important secrets of successful investing. averaging down can be particularly crippling if you hold through a real Stage 4 debacle. Every time you average in the hope of hitting the bottom, you simply add more shares and more losses to your portfolio. The result is that you throw good money after bad. Instead of being a conservative portfolio device, it's actually highly speculative. Trying to guess the bottom in a weak stock is like fishing in the ocean with your fingers. Hope is a foolish reason for holding on, and it's an even worse reason for buying more! So learn to lock in your profits using protective sell-stops, and cut your losses short by recognizing when your stock is running into trouble. If you follow this winning discipline, you'll still have the capital to make up your loss on future purchases.</li> <li>Don't refuse to sell because the overall market trend is bullish. While it's true that a powerful bull market will often bail you out of some of your less brilliant judgments, don't think it's a panacea for every market problem. Sure, the major uptrend will usually add points to your Stage 2 winners. It's also true that a raging bull market will often limit the downside on problem stocks. This is why there is an old Wall Street saying: \"Don't confuse brains with a bull market.\" Nevertheless, if a stock really starts to flash technical danger, don't think twice-get out. Just the fact that a stock is showing weakness in the face of a soaring market is a warning that disaster is getting ready to strike. </li> <li>Don't wait for the next rally to sell. When the chart pattern signals that a stock is running into trouble, get out immediately. Don't wait around trying to recoup an extra point or two on a rally. Chances are this tactic will cost you a lot of your market capital.</li> <li>Don't hold onto a stock simply because it is ofhigh quality. So-called quality stocks have cycles too, and once they turn negative will cause you just as much financial heartache.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Trade/Secrets%20For%20Profiting%20in%20Bull%20and%20Bear%20Markets.html#selling-properly-the-investors-way","title":"SELLING PROPERLY-THE INVESTOR'S WAY","text":"<p>The first thing any good trader or investor should do is realize that they must never hold any position without a protective sell-stop.

That's what you are now going to learn. The first thing to know is that you must be flexible when you place your initial sell-stop. Sometimes it will be 8 percent below your purchase price, other times 12 percent or more. The percentage will not be the determining factor. Instead, the prior support level and 30-week MA will be your two keys to focus on.</p> <p>When you set your initial stop, pay less attention to the MA and more to the prior correction low. Ifstock XYZ is trading in an 18Y4 to 20Y4 zone, and you buy it when it breaks out at 203/ 8, the stop should be placed right below the significant floor of support. You could set the stop at 18Y8 (below the 18Y4 bottom). But here's a little secret that I've learned over the years which has served me well. If the sell-stop should be placed right above a round number, or on it, set it instead just under the round number. For instance, if the stop should be 18Y8 or 18, enter it at 177/ 8. Psychology plays a very big part in market moves, and this is another example of herd instinct. Many investors like to buy at round numbers. If the stock is trading at 18Vz or 18V8, buy orders will often accumulate on the book at 18. Therefore, that level is a tough one to crack. If it's violated, then you really know your stock is running into trouble and you'd better exit quickly. I've seen it happen so often that the proper level for the sell-stop is right above the round number, say 18V8. It hits that level and then only a few hundred shares trade at the round number without it being violated. Then a new rally gets going. To a somewhat lesser degree, this phenomenon also occurs at halves (l8Vz, 19Yz, etc.). So if the sell-stop should be set at 185/ 8, place it below the half at 18318</p> <p>From now on, never hold a stock without a protective sellstop. As soon as you buy an issue, immediately enter a GTC sellstop. This way you will never be left unprotected and end up with an unpleasant surprise staring you in the face when you open the evening newspaper. Also, never enter your order to buy until after you've calculated exactly where your protective stop should be placed. By getting into this habit, you will have an additional filter working for you when you narrow down your list of buy candidates</p> <p>If all of the prior buy criteria that I've outlined for you are met, and you end up with three great buys, you should now check out the initial sell-stop levels. If stock A has a breakout at 20 and the sell-stop should be placed at 177/ 8, then the downside risk is 11 percent. Stock B has its breakout at 40 with a sell-stop level of 337/ 8. That's a downside risk of 15 percent. Finally, C has a breakout at 60 but a protective stop level of 567/ 8. Since that translates into a potential worst-case loss of 5 percent, all other factors being equal, stock C is your best choice from a reward/risk point of view. While there are occasional exceptions because a chart pattern is so outstanding, try to limit your purchases to those cases where the initial stop isn't greater than 15 percent below your purchase price.</p>"},{"location":"Trade/Secrets%20For%20Profiting%20in%20Bull%20and%20Bear%20Markets.html#sell-stops-in-the-real-world","title":"SELL-STOPS IN THE REAL WORLD","text":"<p>Now let's get to specifics so you will be sure to know exactly where your sell-stop should initially be placed, and when and to what level it should later be raised. Stock XYZ was in a trading range of 18V4 to 20V4 before it broke out and moved into Stage 2. You bought the stock at 203/ 8 and the initial stop was set under the round number at 17718. Now all you have to do is sit back and wait. In the unlikely event that the stock breaks down, you will be sold out when the 177/ 8 stop is hit.</p> <p>In the more likely and happy circumstance that your stock starts to move higher, here's what to do. As long as the stock is above its rising 30-week MA, and the MA is rising in Stage 2 fashion, be sure to give it plenty of room to gyrate. We are going to trail the sell-stop behind the advancing price in the following manner. After the first substantial correction of at least 8 to 10 percent, you are now going to get set to raise the stop. But you don't actually change it until your stock ends its correction and moves back toward its prior high (point A on Chart 6-21). If a break below that correction low (point B) would also violate the 30-week MA, that is a valid point to which an investor should raise the sell-stop. If, as in this example, the correction low is above the rising 30-week MA, place the sell-stop below the MA (point C). Continue moving the sell-stop up as the MA advances (points E, G, I, etc.). In this case the correction low is 21, while the MA is up to 20. The sell-stop should therefore now be raised to point C at 19718 (under the round number of 20). One last point. Don't raise the stop to 197/ 8 until after the stock rallies well off the low at point B back close to prior peak A.</p> <p>Next, the stock rockets ahead in normal Stage 2 action after the first correction. After peaking near 35 (point D), it corrects back to the 28 level before resuming the advance. At this point the MA is up to 26. Therefore, when you raise the sell-stop place it at 257 / 8 (point E). Again, don't raise the stop until XYZ rallies to point F, which is close to its prior peak. The next decline to point G terminates right at the MA at 32Y8. After the next rally gets underway and brings the stock close to point F, the stop should be raised to 317/ll-again, under the round number. In the same manner, the sell-stop should later be raised to point I at 387 / 8. At this time, the last low is at 40, while the MA is up to 39Y4.</p> <p>Now comes an important change in tactics, so pay close attention! The MA has stopped rising and flattened out after point I Once this occurs, the probabilities are high that a Stage 3 top is starting to form and the next serious violation of support and the MA can well bring on Stage 4 problems. Therefore, once a stock moves into this higher risk zone you should become more aggressive with your sell-stop. In the case of XYZ, that means moving the stop under the correction low at point K even though it is above the MA. Since K is at 46, raise the sell-stop to 45Vs. Then, in the following weeks, a potential head-and-shoulder top forms with the neckline near 46. Since point M is at 46Y2, which is so close to the 46 stop, you need not raise the stop for such a trivial change. Eventually 46 support is broken, and you are sold out of your position with an excellent profit before a new Stage 4 decline starts to take away a good portion of your gain. </p> <p>Using sell-stops results in a minimum of emotion and misgivings. Your sell will often occur without you even knowing about it, while you are busy with your workday or even on vacation. Best of all, there will be no gut-wrenching decision-making. Should you hold despite the bad news? Should you sell because your broker heard a negative story on the stock? Is XYZ now too high or getting ready to tumble? It's all mechanical and disciplined. Most important of all, we let the market make the judgment for us. And since the market is the ultimate reality when dealing with the trend, its judgment is far more likely to be right than all of our balancing of pros and cons !</p> <p>While it looks like a lot of attention was needed for these sellstop changes, just the opposite is true. Only a few adjustments had to be made over a two-year period. The rest of the time, you just relaxed while the cycle unfolded. Furthermore, you didn't constantly worry about the news headlines and each weekend have a debate with yourself about whether you should hold or sell. Finally, and most important of all, you sold when the market flashed its clear-cut message that the supply/demand equation was turning negative. If you didn't sell, it would have been another case of up, down, profit turned to loss. Not surprisingly, the tremendous gain that took over two years to create vanished in a matter of months once destructive Stage 4 appeared.

How do you define a trader? Should you trade? Why bother trading? Is it better to invest or trade? Those of you who are veterans of the market battle know if you are more inclined to trade or invest. But newcomers often are perplexed about which road to take. Surprisingly, even some seasoned market players are confused in their approach. They may consider themselves investors but actually have a trader's psyche and therefore do poorly.</p> <p>So before getting into the proper way for traders to time their sales, I want to wax philosophical for a moment. I don't really believe there is one absolute truth about whether it is better to trade or invest. I know many very successful traders, and there are certainly scores of winning investors. What I do know is that it is easier for most market players to win big by following the investing path to profits (especially new market participants). It involves less time commitment, less skill, and is certainly easier on your emotions. So why should anyone even consider trading? Simple. Traders need the challenge and the action! Whereas most investors are more conservative by nature and like to keep their lives relaxed and calm, traders are more inclined to live on the edge. They enjoy the thrill of battle and the competitive tensions that come with making decisions on the firing line.</p> <p>The first trading technique to perfect centers on the trailing sell-stop. Traders must be much more aggressive than investors in their use of this tool. Investors ideally want to stay with a position as long as the stock is in Stage 2. They accept the reality that there will be some pretty stiffsetbacks along the way. In addition, months may go by when the stock moves sideways and consolidates before moving higher. Traders, on the other hand, realize that time is money. They not only want to sidestep all significant declines, they even want out if the stock is entering a neutral zone for several months. This makes sense because they can shift into a new stock that is ready to move into the exciting part of its cycle while the old situation simply zigs and zags. Therefore, a trader shouldn't wait for the 30-week MA to be violated on a selloff before selling. (In fact, if he can time the sale nicely when XYZ is well above the MA, the trader will often repurchase on dips back close to the MA.)</p>"},{"location":"Trade/Secrets%20For%20Profiting%20in%20Bull%20and%20Bear%20Markets.html#trending-toward-profits","title":"TRENDING TOWARD PROFITS","text":"<p>In many cases, no valid trendline will form and you should simply use the trading sell-stop concept. But when an aggressive trendline does take shape, use it, because it's a way of locking in even more of the profit. At least a portion of the position should be sold when such a trendline is violated. Then the remainder can be handled via the sell-stop route, which will usually be at a somewhat lower level.</p> <p>When integrating trendlines into your trading game plan, start out in the same manner as you did in the prior example. Set the initial stop at 193/ 8 (point A) when you buy on the breakout at 20Jfs. Then raise the sell-stop to B as the stock rallies back toward peak G. A clear-cut trendline is one that connects at least three points. If a trendline materializes, it should be brought into your analysis of where to place your stop. After XYZ rallied off of point C, the sell-stop should be placed under C. Here's where the trendline can start to help you. Now that it's been in force for several months and has been touched at least three times, you should raise the stop further to a point under the trendline. First you'll raise it to D, then a few weeks later to E and F. Since the trendline is a rising one, you can continue raising the stop on this half of the position even if the stock moves sideways, as it did following point I. One half of your position is now protected with a stop at point C, and one half is set very tightly at rising points D, E, and finally F. Eventually the sell-stop at F is set off as the stock drifts sideways. Even if it doesn't indicate a sharp drop, it's likely to lead to a neutral trading range. This is bad news for traders, so it's good to lock in the profit on half the position.

You must also understand the winning philosophy that accompanies the methodology. Most market participants view profits and losses in a way that I can only categorize as strange. Their view also makes for odd and destructive decisions. Ask eight out of ten investors who bought stock XYZ at 40 how much they've lost now that the stock is down to 20, and they'll answer nothing! The conventional wisdom says that as long as I don't sell the stock, I haven't taken any loss; or it's just a paper loss. That's ridiculous! Your stock is only worth the price of the last print on the tape. It's an asset that can be sold any time the market is open. If you decide to cash in your chips on any given position, you can take that money and do as you wish with it. But because of this nonsensical view that a stock in which they are losing 50 percent is not a loss, they hold and hold, waiting for it to come back to even so they won't have to feel stupid. Not only are they suffering needless additional shrinkage of capital, they are missing out on the chance to shift the funds into new Stage 2 situations. The converse is also ridiculous. Ifthey bought a stock at 40 and it's run up to 80, they feel they don't have a profit because they haven't sold yet. Instead, they talk about playing with 'their' money.

Don't worry if it swings a few percent from week to week. That's the way of the market. But if you see your assets drop by 20 to 25 percent, something is wrong. If you're using sellstops, perhaps you are taking too much risk by buying stocks that are too far above their stop-loss points. If that isn't the case, then it's possible that you are taking far too many small losses in a row because the negative market climate is whipsawing you in position after position.

Short selling increases the stock's liquidity on the downside, so when an issue gets smashed, its decline is eventually cushioned. After all, a person who has sold XYZ short has to repurchase that stock at some point. Every short sale represents future demand for the stock. When it declines and short sellers buy back the stock, this demand actually slows the drop</p> <p>A second bogey-man that keeps so many from selling short is that classic excuse, you can lose everything you have! The thinking (or nonthinking) goes something like this: If you buy XYZ at 40, the worst that can happen is that the company goes bankrupt and the stock ends up dropping to zero. But if you sell short, there is no upside limit. It can advance toward infinity. Since infinity brings to mind the size of the universe and other imponderables, this theoretical danger is enough to make most investors stop right in their tracks. They dismiss the idea of short selling and go back to what they perceive as being safe, such as buying Stage 4 patterns in a bear market</p> <p>While there is a remote theoretical possibility of a stock jumping higher and higher, thus wiping you out while you are short, there is zero possibility of that happening when you follow my methods. You've now read and digested enough of my approach to know the answer even before I tell you what it is: a protective buy-stop. This device will guarantee that you never suffer the horrible fate of infinite loss and eternal pain and suffering. It's no different from what I taught you on the buy side. In the same manner that a properly placed protective sell-stop will make it impossible for you to ever carry any stock from 40 down to zero, so, too, will an intelligently placed protective buy-stop assure that you'll never hold XYZ short as it advances from 40 to 200! Once you learn how to implement this important tool, you'll quickly see that it's nonsense to listen to your friends and relatives who warn you against the evils of shorting. You won't lose the house, car, and even the kids, as so many amateurs fear. On a worst case basis, you'll suffer a 10to 15percent loss on a position that moves against you. This is no different than what happens on the long side when one of your purchases doesn't work out and your sell-stop is set off.</p>"},{"location":"Trade/Secrets%20For%20Profiting%20in%20Bull%20and%20Bear%20Markets.html#common-mistakes-when-shorting","title":"COMMON MISTAKES WHEN SHORTING","text":"<ol> <li>Using overvaLuation as your criteria for shorting. Don't ever fall into the trap of thinking that a high PIE means you should sell short. I've talked about the subjectivity of overvaluation before. It's such a fuzzy concept when considering short-sale candidates that you should swear off of it entirely. I could fill up page after page of this book with examples of stocks that looked to be too high based on their PIE ratios but went much higher in the months ahead.  fundamental overvaluation is not the way to uncover a choice short sale even though it is the most common method among the rank and file of market players</li> <li>Selling short because the stock has advanced too far. Another very destructive approach used by many traders and investors is selling short when they feel a stock has run up too far. If you like Russian roulette, this is your kind of game. But it's just a matter of time until the gun goes off and you get hit with a huge loss. People who play this game are selling short while the stock is charging ahead in Stage 2, and then they can't understand why they get clobbered. But now that you understand stage analysis, you can see why they get their heads handed to them by trying to guess a Stage 2 top</li> <li>Falling for the sucker short. The stock market has the equivalent of a too-good-to-be-true offer. We've all seen cases where you know that the deal is just too good to be offered for such a pittance. A closer investigation usually reveals that your instincts were correct and there really are no free lunches. In the market this takes the form of a sucker short. This is a stock that has risen so far in excess ofits apparent sensible value that it seems destined to fall. Every market cycle has a number of sucker shorts and they end up doing a nose dive-but usually long after you've been squeezed out of your short position for a great loss. Such stocks combine both factors that I've cautioned you to avoid: a high PIE, and a sharp advance. In addition, the stock usually gets a lot of media attention because ofits eye-popping runup. Finally, and most dangerous of all, it has a very large short interest! relative to the average daily trading volume. Whereas many stocks have a short interest equal to three to four times the average daily trading (which is on the high side), these too-obvious shorts often have a short position five times or more the average daily volume. Never forget this point: Don't ever short a stock that is above its rising 30-week MA. If you understand all that I've taught you about buying, then you know how to sell short-you just don't realize it yet. Everything is simply reversed. Just as you should never buy a stock that is trading below its 30-week MA, you should never sell short any stock that is still above its rising 30-week MA no matter how enticing it may seem.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Trade/Secrets%20For%20Profiting%20in%20Bull%20and%20Bear%20Markets.html#other-short-selling-errors","title":"Other SHORT-SELLING ERRORS","text":"<p>It's also important that you don't sell short a stock that is too thin.

While they don't occur with great frequency, they do form more often than head-and shoulder bottom patterns, and they do appear often enough to be a source of great gain. In fact, when you start to see a bevy of these formations occurring, it's a signal that a major market top is moving into place.</p> <p>The first ingredient of a valid head-and-shoulder top pattern is a stock which has been very strong and already had a substantial advance. The beauty of this formation is its ability to spot trend reversals. If there's no big prior upmove to reverse, forget it; it's not going to be exciting. Volume should be well above average on the advance, as the latecomers rush in close to the end of the move. Then along comes a correction, as profit-taking sets in (B-C on Chart 7-26). Once the selloff runs its course (point C), the stock then shoots ahead to another new high (point D). No problem yet, except that on this second rally, volume usually stops expanding and is often less than on the preceding rise. This is the first sign of potential trouble. The dwindling volume reflects lessened buying interest at this lofty level.</p> <p>A second correction (D-E) then quickly sets in. This is another sign that something is starting to go wrong. After breaking to a new high (point D), the stock appears to be embarking on a new upleg as the buyers' greed glands start to work overtime. Instead, the stock only moves ahead a few points and then quickly sells off once again. The clincher that tells you weakness is setting in is how far back this second decline (D-E) carries. As I've shown you before, when dealing with support areas, the former peak (B) should act as support when the stock starts to decline. The fact that the decline instead carries the stock all the way to the prior low (C) is a distinct negative</p> <p>Now you have a potential left shoulder (A-B-C) and head (C-DE) as well as a trendline (C-E) connecting the two correction lows. This trendline is the potential neckline ofthe head-and-shoulder top formation and must be watched very carefully. If it breaks, watch out! Now it all hinges on the next rally. Will the upward momentum reassert itself, or is the stock getting too tired, and sellers increasingly anxious? Whatever you do, don't jump the gun. Don't anticipate that most of the pieces of the puzzle are in place for a short sale. In about one-third of the cases, these potential top formations will not move to completion and will instead end up breaking out on the upside.</p> <p>There are a few other subtleties that you should be aware of. The first can easily be summed up in a rhyme that I've used for years: the bigger the top, the bigger the drop. The longer this bearish formation takes to form, the more powerful the eventual downmove will be. While all head-and-shoulder top patterns are negative, one that forms in three weeks isn't as powerful as one that unfolds over a nine-month span. This makes sense because the more time the stock spends forming the pattern, the more buyers who are trapped in that top area.

I Finally, there are now many funds that offer both an aggressive stock fund as well as a money market fund. To induce you to keep your money in their coffers, they allow switching back and forth between funds, usually with just a phone call. This immediately sets up the potential for a very profitable trading and investing game. All we have to do is buy an aggressive fund when the market turns clearly bullish (such as in mid-1982 and late 1986), and sell and move into a money market fund when Stage 4 appears (as in January 1984 and early October 1987)</p> <p>The advantage of using mutual funds to capitalize on the market's cycles is that you don't have to pore over page after page of individual stock charts.

Since this exciting mutual-fund technique looks so easy and profitable, should you forget about stocks and use it exclusively? My answer is: for most of you, no! The potential is more dynamic in individual stocks than in funds, so it would be a mistake to totally ignore that area. But depending on your personality and the time you can allot to the market, you should work out the mix between mutual-fund switching and stock purchases. If you are very committed to the market and want to devote a couple of hours a week, you should obviously place a greater emphasis on stocks and less on funds. But even this type of investor should place some capital in the switch-fund game. I especially recommend that you use fund switching for your IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) and pension funds, while putting your more aggressive money into individual stocks.

You actually have an advantage over the large institutions; most investors just don't realize it. The institutions are like dinosaurs; they have big bodies and move very slowly. You, however, can turn on a dime and act very quickly. In addition, most of the hot-shot money managers really haven't performed that well over a long period of time.

Then, if the clues at the first milepost are correctly deciphered, the participant can get to the second mile-post where additional clues will be available.

How quickly and correctly one can decipher the clues will determine who will get the treasure. Among the clues offered, some will be red herrings and false clues meant to mislead the players.

I am wary when the group does not show strength among sister stocks. In the absence of sister stocks, we are either talking about a monopoly stock doing well in group or one stock doing well in a week group. If there is a monopoly stock doing well in a weak group, i might still be interested in the stock due to its monopoly type status.

Moreover, this ability to rise in prices must be on increased volume. This tells me that there is great buying interest in the stock. When a stock has such buying interest, odds are unlikely that it will get sold out. Once the up trend has stopped for a resting phase or the consolidation phase, volume must start to cool down. More the volume contraction, better the stock. When volume dies after rising stock rises in price on volume it tells me that all the buyer who bought during the rising phase are not willing to sell out. Low volume consolidation indicates higher prices to come with all the buyers having serious conviction of the stock\u2019s upward trend</p> <p>The tighter the price range during the consolidation the better. This adds to the conviction that nobody is willing to sell the stock. In perfect stock, the consolidation price range would not exceed 10-20% and the volume would contract clearly with at least a week or two of volumes of trade that shrink well below 50% of normal weekly volume. And when the stock pierces its prior high on volume, it has psychologically cleared a ceiling or upper resistance band.

And the folks with the money make things happen. And there is reason behind every move. The reason may or may not be obvious and in many cases it never become clear. Most of the times it does not become clear to even the most astute of observers. Should the astute observer figure out the reason behind any specific move, it is most times clear only in hindsight.</li> <li>All participants in the market are human beings. Theer are no aliens or animal participants. It follows, therefore, everything that happen in market is due to human action. Humans are the only buyers and sellers. The price settles at the end of the day at a level where all the buyers and the sellers for a particular stock come to a balanced agreement for a price for that day. what happens intraday is mainly noise.</li> <li>I have learned that to watch the market during the market hours is like slow death. Every price tick up and down just drives me nuts. And i end up making on the spot stupid decisions due to chart or news. the move always occurs well before the news. The smart money usually sells into good news and only to buy it back at a reaction. That is because smart money had discounted the news weeks before it became news. when news are released public gets exited and smart money can sell into the increased volume of buying from the public.</li> <li>when i watch the market, it turns out to be nothing more than an online casino where the odds are against me. the only time i have made big money when i only relied on myself and nobody else.</li> <li>I find that my interpretation and decisions based on my own interpretations work well for me. And they work best with distance form the noise and news. the distance allows me to see the market from my own eyes instead of relying on someone else\u2019s view.</li> <li>If i want to buy a car, i would go to dealership, test drive the car that feels and look right to me. then if the price is right , i make decision to buy. I would never buy a car because some car broker calls me on the phone and describes the car to me. this same thing can be apply to buying house.</li> <li>But humans will buy large amounts of stock based on a phone call from broker. Why we do that? because of promise of riches. The buy is made to enrich ourselves rather quickly. It is no different in that respect from a casino. we bet in a casino to enrich ourselves.</li> <li>The only consistent winner in the stock market is the one who places his commitments based on probabilities and not on possibilities.</li> <li>There\u2019s thin line between gambler and speculator. Speculation is placing commitments only when odds are in one\u2019s favor. The action is not taken by a speculator unless and until the odds favor him. the gambler will make commitments without regards to the odds of wins.</li> <li>You know for years i used to write newsletter. I would make comments on market\u2019s general trend. I would try and make the point that the best odds of wins are when one limits one\u2019s trade to only preiods of confirmed trends in market. So it would always payoff to be buying only during market up trends and to be staying in cash during downtrends or uncertain trends.</li> <li>Constant bullishness would win more subscribers than the constantly correct market calls.

Having events and circumstances thought out in advance is a key to manging risk effectively and building your capital account.</p> <p>the mark of a professional is proper preparation. Before I make a trade, I have already worked out responses to meet virtually any conceivable development that ay take place. And if and when a new set of circumstances present themselves, I add them to my contingency plans. As new unexpected issues present themselves, the contingency plan playbook is expanded. By implementing contingency planning, you can take swift, decisive action the instant one of your positions changes its behaviour or is hit with an unexpected event.</p> <p>you should have contingency plans for the following</p> <ol> <li>where you will get out if the position goes against you</li> <li>what the stock must do to be considered for purchase again in the event you get stopped out of the trade</li> <li>Criteria for selling into strength and nailing down a decent gain</li> <li>When to sell into weakness to protect your profit</li> <li>How you will handle catastrophic situations and sudden changes that require swift decisive action under pressure</li> </ol> <p>Your contingency plan should include the following elements</p> <ul> <li>Initial stop loss</li> <li>re-entry criteria<ul> <li>Some stocks will set up constructively and attract buyers, but then they quickly undergo a correction or sharp pullback that stops you out.

But if you get stopped out of your position, don\u2019t automatically discard it as a future buy candidate. If the stock still has all the characteristics of a potential winner, look for a reentry point. The first time around your timing may have been a bit off. It could take two or even three tries to catch a big winner. this is a trait of a professional trader.

Specifically I am looking for digestion period and consolidation of the previous gains made during the uptrend or for what I call VCP(volatility contraction pattern).</p> <p>Throughout my career, I have found that almost every failed base can be traced back to some faulty characteristic that was overlooked. Many books superficially describe technical patterns, and pattern recognition exercises will often lead you astray if you lack an understanding of the supply and demand forces that give rise to high-probability setups.</p> <p>The most common characteristic shared by constructive price structures (stocks that are under accumulation) is a contraction of volatility accompanied by specific areas in the base where volume recedes noticeably. Determining correct VCP is the key to establishing the precise point and time to enter a stock. In virtually all the chart patterns i rely on, i\u2019m looking for volatility to contract from left to right. I want to see the stock move from greater volatility on the left side of the price to lesser volatility on the right side.</p> <p>During VCP, you will generally see sequence of anywhere from two to six price contractions. this progressive reduction in price volatility, which is always accompanied by a reduction in volume at specific points, signifies that the base has been completed. For example stock will initially come off by 25% from its absolute high to its low. then the stock rallies a bit, and then sells off 15 percent. at that point buyers come back in, and the price rallies a bit more within the base. Finally it retreats by 8%.</p> <p>As a rule of thumb, each successive contraction is generally contained to about half (plus or minus a resonable amount) of the previous pullback or contraction. Volatility, measured from high to low, will be greatest when sellers rush to take profits. As sellers become scarcer, the price correction will not be as dramatic, and volatility will decrease as the price makes its way to the right side of the base. Typically most vcp setups will be formed by two to four contractions, although sometimes there can be as many as five or six. this action will produce a pattern, which also reveals the symmetry of the contractions being formed. I refer to each of these contractions as \u201cT\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Trade/Think%20and%20Trade%20like%20a%20Champion.html#the-contraction-count","title":"The Contraction count","text":"\ud83d\udca1 Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening with successive contractions.

Probably it\u2019s at least damp. as you keep twisting and wringing the towel to get all the water out, each time the drops will be less and less. finally the towel is dry and much lighter.   <p>Similarly, with each contraction in a VCP, the price of the stock gets \u201ctighter\u201d meaning, it corrects less and less from left to right on successively lower volume as the supply diminishes. Like the wet towel being wrung dry, as a stock goes through several contractions, it becomes lighter and can move in one direction much more easily than when it was weighed down with lots of supply.</p> <p>Here how it works in real life.</p> <p>As the stock moves through the $17 area, you can see how fast it advances with little resistance. the reason is that supply has stopped coming to market. with little supply available, even small amount of demand can move the stock up. and if your long term work is accurate, and big institutions are indeed in there accumulating the stock , the sky could be the limit. this is a vital concept for successfully timing your buys.</p> <p>A price consolidation represents a period of equilibrium. As strong investors replace weak traders, supply is absorbed. Once the \u201cweak hands\u201d have been eliminated, the lack of supply allows the stock to move higher because even a small amount of demand will overwhelm the negligible inventory. This is what the legendary trader Jesse Livermore called \u201c the line of least resistance\u201c</p> <p>Tightness in price from absolute highs to lows and tight closes with little change in price from one day to the next and from one week to the next are generally constructive. these tight areas should be accompanied by a significant decrease in trading volume.</p> <p>In some instances volume dries up at or near the lowest levels established since the beginning of the stock\u2019s advance. this is a very positive development, especially if it takes place after period of correction and consolidation, and is a telltale sign that the amount of stock coming to market has diminished.

You have a position in a stock that\u2019s doing great, and you use that strength to sell into. This is how pros sell, especially if they have sizable position to unload.

As the mountain rises, there are plateaus; this is where the price ascent stops or rests for a bit. If this were a real mountain, these plateaus would be where climbers would establish base camps to rest recharge. This is exactly what happens with a stock\u2019s price action. </p> <p>Following a run upward, there is osome profit taking, causing a temporary pullback. This activity causes the stock to decline and build a base  a short term pause that llows the stock to digest its previous run-up.

That\u2019s your golden opportunity to get into stocks that are coming out of their early to mid stage bases. After a bear market decline, the initial plateau counts as the first base. When stocks are coming out of bases 1 or 2 following a market correction, that\u2019s generally the best time to jump onboard a new trend. bases 3 and 4 can also work, but are later in the cycle and should be treated more as trading opportunities. Bases 5 or 6 are extremely failure prone and should be viewed as opportunities to sell into soon after a price breakout gets extended. Sometimes the later-stage bases can get exciting as stocks can often experience climactic moves during late stage \u201c blowoff\u201d runups.

We often hear how someone got a lucky break by being at the right place at the right time.</li> <li>As for those who say \u201cyou can\u2019t time the market,\u201d that usually means they can\u2019t time the market, so they can't imagine anyone being able to do so. Keep in mind, your timing isn\u2019t always going to be correct. In fact, you are likely to be correct only about half the time. It\u2019s how you manager the winners and losers that will turn your timing into performance.</li> <li>If you ever want to do anything great with your life, you must stop believing those who say you can\u2019t. This naysaying always comes from the mouths of people who never did it themselves.</li> <li>when you are trading individual stocks, especially smaller, under-followed names, timing becomes much easier than trying to figure out the direction of the entire market day to day. Your job is to time your purchases along the \u201cline of least resistance.\u201d As discussed previously, the line of least resistance is the price level from which a stock can move very quickly, making a large scale advance in a short period of time. I call these velocity trades.</li> <li>As a trader pursuing SportPerformance, you should always be on the lookout for velocity trades, which can make gains on the order of 20,30, or 50% over a few weeks or a few months. With velocity trades, you can compound your money very rapidly.

To generate a big return consistently, you need to be concentrated among the very best names- somewhere between four and twelve, depending on your account size and risk tolerance. In fact, when things work well, I like to have most of my money in the top four or five names that I am following closely. Regardless of what you may have heard or read, there is no need for an individual investor to be widely diversified.</li> <li>I am not suggesting you load up on stocks and trade aggressively all the time; just the opposite. The way to make big money in stocks is to be concentrated at the right time - when things are working and moving in your direction and to trade lightly when trading gets difficult. That means you must stay on top of your stocks. you can\u2019t possibly do that effectively if you own dozen of names. With a concentrated portfolio, you can keep a close eye on every name and move quicky into or out of positions.

Speed is your big advantage.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Turnover is not taboo<ul> <li>Another rule among most money managers and mutual funds is to keep portfolio turnover low because of commissions and for tax reasons Buying and selling frequently is frowned upon for them. But if you have an edge and you\u2019re running a concentrated portfolio, turnover can be a good thing. Trading in and out of positions could further your goal of compounding your money rapidly, if you have an edge. With every trade, you are trying to make as much as possible in the shortest possible time frame, so you can go on to the next potential wining trade and maximize compounding. That\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t hold a stock if it continues to act well, but you want to lose as little time value as possible.</li> <li>Here\u2019s a simplified example. : let\u2019s say that you\u2019re flipping a coin, and every time it comes up heads you make 2$ and when it comes up tails you lose 1$. given the statistical probability of heads being the result half the time and 2:1 payoff, the more you flip, the more you make because of the mathematical edge. An edge in the stock market works much the same way. I\u2019m not going to keep myself from selling one stock and buying another because I\u2019m concerned about having a high turnover rate or because I will have to pay taxes on the gain my goal is to have gains to pay taxes on. I buy a stock when the probability is high for reward verses risk, and I sell when the risk of owing it gets too high. I never make a sell decision based on turnover or tax reasons.</li> <li>Bottom line: if you get a sell signal, get out. Or, if something looks more appealing, move out of less attractive name and into something better. Traders don\u2019t get married to a stock they just date. Your money should always be moving to where you are going to reap the best performance and moving out of trouble situations that put your capital at risk. you may even move to cash when there are few compelling stocks. As a result, much of your turnover will be the result of cutting losses and managing risk. You want to hold a key leader for a big move when the time is right, but don\u2019t underestimate the power of smaller wins compounded. With an edge, turnover is good.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Always maintain risk/reward relationship<ul> <li>Here all the keys to generating super performance come together: timing, a concentrated portfolio, the willingness to move into and out of positions, and now, managing risk versus reward. You are poised to take advantage of a huge upside, with protection that allows you to move out of a position quickly, if and when something moves against you. By continuously rebalancing the risk and reward, you negate or mitigate any downside to being highly concentrated among a few names in your portfolio. You should take a short-term approach to losses and a relatively longer-term approach to gains. that means you cut your losses and let your winners run. Regardless of the time frame, I always maintain the risk/reward relationship. for example, if I think there\u2019s a decent chance that a stock can trade up 15% , i set my stop at 7 or 8 percent or less. Even if it\u2019s a 50/50 chance that i\u2019m right, it\u2019s a good risk reward play because i\u2019m only risking 7 % to gain 15%.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Trade/Think%20and%20Trade%20like%20a%20Champion.html#the-four-keys-to-limiting-drawdowns","title":"The four keys to limiting drawdowns","text":"<ul> <li>While stops are a great discipline, you must set them at a level that makes sense so that you are controlling risk in relation to reward. If you don\u2019t maintain the correct balance, you might find yourself taking on big risk in return for only a small payoff. The objective here is to do the opposite, take a small risk in return for a big potential reward.</li> <li>Sell into strength<ul> <li>Always keep in in mind, it\u2019s generally better to sell early than late. A stock you bought has risen steadily; your position is up 20,30 or 40% so what do you do? The answer divides the pros from the amateurs.</li> <li>Professional traders sell into strength. They want to sell when there are eager buyers. Amateurs, on the other hand, get happy and giddy, thinking that their rising stock is never going down. The greed sets in and they don\u2019t sell. Even when a 30% gain turns into 40 or 50% gain, they refuse to get out while the getting is good.</li> <li>Granted, after you sell, the stock may keep on going, rallying even further without you in it. You can grumble and complain about money you didn\u2019t make because you got out after, say a 40 % gain and the stock ended up doubling or tripling over a longer period of time. That\u2019s going to happen.</li> <li>But if you fail to sell into strength, you\u2019ll set yourself up for a far bigger problem than potential profits left on the table. If you wait too long to sell, the uptrend will end and the stock will come erasing back down. You might shake off the first dip, after all, stocks rarely rise of fall in one direction. But the 5% drop turns into 15% drop,  and now you really don\u2019t want to sell because you\u2019re kicking yourself for not selling higher. Wait too long, though and the stock could break even harder, giving back all or most of your gains. When you do sell, your profit is either greatly reduced or fully negated, and all because you were afraid of missin gout on more upside.</li> <li>It\u2019s far better to sell into strength than wait too long and lose all or most of the sizeable gain you once had. When you sell into strength , your equity value is at its highest point. If you want to maintain an equity curve that consistently stair step up, you should learn how to sell when you have a decent gain while the stock is advancing.</li> <li>Waiting too logn to sell also runs risk of losing time value. when you hold a stock through a significant correction, you may have to go through weeks, months, or longer before it starts another leg up. During that time, you\u2019re tying up your money instead of getting out at profit and moving on to the next best opportunity.</li> <li>Remember the lesson on time value: thanks to the power of compounding, if you can get small but consistent return and repeat it over and over, it could be far more productive than trying for a bigger return that takes several months or even years to produce.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Trade small before you trade big<ul> <li>But when things aren\u2019t working so well\u2014perhaps your analysis is correct, but your timing is off\u2014you can\u2019t remain aggressive. That\u2019s when it\u2019s time to slow down or even take a break from trading as you analyze why you\u2019re out of sync with the market. This is the essence of letting the market guide you, instead of following your opinions or hunches. Developing this self-control will train you to listen to and trust the market, not your \u201cgut.\u201d Your intuition has no business in your trading. Personal feelings are seldom a substitute for facts.</li> <li>Here\u2019s how it works in real-life trading: You make a few purchases from your list of stocks that you\u2019re watching as they trigger buy points. Once you\u2019ve logged a few gains or a number of your positions are showing some net progress, these results will \u201cfinance\u201d the risk for bigger trades. Let\u2019s say you make $1,000 on one trade and then $1,000 on another, for a total of $2,000. You can now afford to trade a little larger. You can risk $2,000 to make $4,000, because that risk is already \u201cfinanced\u201d by the $2,000 in banked profits. Moreover, you\u2019re trading more aggressively on the heels of profitable trades, pyramiding your way to bigger positions, instead of working your way out of a hole.</li> <li>When losses mount, it takes a toll not only financially, but also emotionally. Your confidence gets shaken. But by following the market\u2019s guidance as it \u201ctells\u201d you whether your strategy and timing are on or off, you won\u2019t ever get too far off track. As a result, your capital and your confidence will remain intact.</li> <li>Losses are valuable information that things aren\u2019t working. Your timing is off, or perhaps the market is weighing on stocks in general. Why would you want to throw good money after bad if something isn\u2019t working well? If you do, then your ego is more invested in your opinion than in the actual market. This rule is one of the most important disciplines to keep your drawdowns low.</li> <li>Yet, most investors don\u2019t operate this way. When things get difficult and losses mount, most investors \u201crevenge trade\u201d and try to get it back quickly. This means trading larger or doubling up on losing positions to get back the money they lost. Occasionally and in the short run, this can work and bail you out of a losing streak. Over the long run, though, it will only lead to large drawdowns and invite disaster</li> </ul> </li> <li>Always trade directionally<ul> <li>You must trade directionally. If you try to go against the tred, you will seldom be correct. Once trend is established for example , a stock you like has come under selling pressure it\u2019s very risky to buy, thinking that at some point it will come back. There is usually a low likelihood of that stock reversing the trend and making a sustained move in your direction precisely when you expect. If you\u2019re using relatively tight stops, even a small decline could stop you out and produce a losing trade. These losses can add up, so the goal is to buy at exactly the precise moment when the risk of loss is minimal.</li> <li>I never buy a falling stock. I always trade directionally. This applies to all time frames, from long term investing to swing trading and even day trading. allowing the market to guide you puts you in sync with it, which increases your chances of makign a profit and limiting losses. Over time you will, at a minimum experience smaller drawdowns.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Protect your breakeven point once you have attained a decent gain<ul> <li>Protect your principle as soon as possible. How and when this occurs will depend a lot on market conditions and how well your trading is progressing. If market conditions are challenging, I will be quicker to protect the downside, moving my stop up more quickly and being less forgiving of any adverse moves against me. If my strategy and timing are in sync with the market, then i\u2019ll be more forgiving and allow my stocks a bit more room. As your trade becomes profitable and shows a decent gain, you want to protect your breakeven point or at least move up your stop to lessen your risk.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Trade/Think%20and%20Trade%20like%20a%20Champion.html#the-eight-keys-in-your-hands","title":"The eight keys in your hands","text":"<p>I realized that to get big returns I didn\u2019t necessarily need to find giant winners in the stock market (although that remains my ultimate goal).

With detachment from the outcome, you have the ability to access a strategy with total cerntainty. You know that sometimes you\u2019ll win and sometimes you\u2019ll lose. You detach from whatt happen once you place the trade. Detachment, which is grounded in eastern philosophy, keeps you from being, affected by negative emotions such as fear. To achieve that state, you have to create what i call your emotional forecefield. </p> <p>One example and mark, i know you practice this one every day is the \u201cmental rehearsal\u201d. Before going on to explain, let me point out one important distinction. A mental rehersaliss not visualization and that\u2019s where a lot of people go wrong. Positive visualization is imagining the best possible results. But that\u2019s not reality. For a trader, that would mean visualizing every trade going your way, which is impossible. If you visualize everything positive and you have a loss, your nervous system freaks out, and all your fears come true.</p> <p>Mastering those fears requires a mental rehearsal. In your mind, you start out with the mental picture of what you want to see to make a great trade. By following your plan, step by step, you move into and out of the market effortlessly. However, you also picture yourself doing the exact same thing\u2014diligently following your plan and identifying the perfect setup\u2014but this time you envision the market going against you. The stock doesn\u2019t follow through the way you had expected. Your trade is stopped out at a small loss. You see yourself accepting that loss, taking a breath, shaking it off, and sitting back down to identify your next trade. Your mental rehearsal includes seeing yourself achieving positive outcomes on some trades, and getting hit by obstacles and having losses on others. The more you rehearse and see yourself able to stick to your discipline and your plan, no matter the outcome, the better you\u2019ll be able to tame your anxiety. You will see yourself resisting the temptation to chase a stock. You see yourself holding your stops and getting out of a trade with a small loss, even if the stock turns around and rallies without you on board. You know these things are going to happen to you, just like they do to every trader.</p> <p>Mark : Here\u2019s how i like to explain. You have go from outcome to process. Using another sports analogy, if you\u2019re up at bat, you are not going to hit home runs by being focused or preoccupied with the scoreboard. Your goal is to score runs. But if you put all your attention on the task at hand, you will hit well, and score will reflect it My own personal performance went from mediocre to stellar when I finally said to heck with the money. I\u2019m taking my focus off the score board. I\u2019m going to focus on being the best trader i can be and concentrate on making every decision a quality choice. Then the results appeared. Making money is the result or by product of effectively carrying out a well thought out plan. Focusing on the money or the outcome will only distract you from the work you need to do achieve the desired result. The money will only come after you execute your plan. So, that\u2019s what i focus on.</p> <p>Jairek:  As part of your daily preparation, you want to activate your body and optimize your mental and emotional state. Here is a technique I learn from an ex-Navy Seal. it\u2019s called \u201cbox breathing\u201d. You breathe in through your nose for four seconds, hold your breath for four seconds. then you breathe out through your mouth for four seconds and hold like that for four seconds. Do this for five minutes. This allows you to focus your mind by concentrating on your breath. Five minutes of box breathing disassociates you from anything else. If you are completely focused on your breathing, your mind cannot form fears or anxieties or negative thoughts. And, breathing like this gets oxygen to your brain. A lot of people stop breathing when they get fearful. you are recentred emotionally and refuled with oxygen.</p> <p>Mark:  Jairek, you\u2019ve discussed the emotional and physical preparation, what else can help traders prepare mentally for the trading day- especially to master their fear? As I\u2019ve found in all my years of teaching and coaching traders, and now with my seminars, if I give people rules, that\u2019s not enough. For one thing, they don\u2019t always follow the rules. Trading is not a game of certainty, but a game of probability and the rules are what move the odds in their Favor. I can teach them my strategy and the mechanics, but they go home with their idiosyncrasies. And so they lose their confidence, and in some cases regress into a myopic state focusing on the most recent trades and losing perspective or what i call reference to the whole.</p> <p>Jairek:   Here\u2019s another preparation that can help affirm discipline and adherence to the rules. Every day, before you trade, review what happened the day before. First, you identify what great things happened the day before in your trading\u2014not just the wins, but also when you stuck to your discipline, like getting stopped out for a small loss. Second, identify two or three lessons learned that led to good results\u2014or that you realize now from painful outcomes. Write down the lessons learned every day. Some traders will find, as they write down the lessons from the day before, that they keep repeating the same ones, over and over. That will keep occurring until they master whatever it is they need to learn. Third, ask yourself, \u201cHow am I going to improve today?\u201d Again, write it down so you can record where you see the need for improvement.</p> <p>Starting the trading day with these three questions\u2014what went great, what were the lessons learned, and how am I going to improve\u2014will help traders learn from their results and improve. Bringing it all together\u2014mental rehearsal, box breathing, activating your body, and asking these three questions\u2014you can become better prepared for the trading day.</p> <p>Mark: Yes! It\u2019s all about empowering yourself. To do that you need to understand yourself. Each trader is different. For some, buying correctly is the problem, while for someone else selling may be the issue. I always recommend that you print out charts of your trades and mark with a pen where you bought and sold. As you study these trades, you will almost always find a common denominator, something that you do repeatedly.</p>"},{"location":"Trade/Trade%20Like%20a%20Stock%20Market%20Wizard.html","title":"Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard by Mark Minervini","text":""},{"location":"Trade/Trade%20Like%20a%20Stock%20Market%20Wizard.html#chapter-2-what-you-need-to-know-first","title":"Chapter 2 : What you need to Know first","text":"<p>During every bull and bear market for the last three decades I have heard the words \u201cIt\u2019s different this time.\u201d Surely, during the 1920s, the legendary stock trader Jesse Livermore heard these same words.
