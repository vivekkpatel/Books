# Books
- The goal of this repository is to track every book I've read and to manage my notes.

# Future improvements
- Let's see you can conver this repo in some kind of website.I would like to convert this into a standalone website or integrate it with AI so I can continuously reuse the knowledge I've gained from these books.
- One more use case I can think of this repo is using the book notes is I can create my custom agents whenever I need to find solution to specific problem.
